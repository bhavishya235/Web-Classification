It is a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph designed to operate with high efficiency from the atmospheric cut-off at 300 nmto the long wavelength limit of the CCD detectors (about 1100 nm). To this aim, the light beam from the telescope is split in two arms (UV to Blue,and Visual to Red) within the instrument. The two arms can be operated separately, or in parallel via a dichroic beam splitter. The resolving power is about 40,000 when a 1-arcsec slit is used. The maximum (two-pixel) resolution is 80,000 or 110,000 in the Blue- and the Red Arm, respectively. Three image slicers are also available to obtain high resolving power without excessive slit loss. The instrument is built for maximum mechanical stability and allows for accurate wavelength calibration. An iodine cell can be inserted in the light beam for observations requiring extremely high accuracy for radial velocity measurements. Publications based on data obtained with the UVES instrument should quote the following reference paper: Dekker, H. et al. 2000, SPIE, 4008, 534 .

 Bohdan Paczynski 1940-2007 The MOA group notes with deep sadness the death on April 19 of the leading pioneer of gravitational microlensing in the observational era, Professor Bohdan Paczynski of Princeton University. All members of the international microlensing community benefited from Bohdan’s scientific insight and unstinting support. He will be greatly missed. Further information on Bohdan Paczynski is at News@Princeton The MOA OGLE groups recently reported evidence for free-floating planets from survey data taken in 2006 and 2007. Ten microlensing events were found with durations corresponding to Jupiter-mass lenses. The presence of stellar lenses within ~ 10 AU was excluded. These planets may have been ejected from planetary systems through gravitational interactions. The measured ratio of free-floating planets to stars is approximately 1.8. The illustration depicts an infrared image of one of the planets, MOA-ip-10, and the Einstein arcs through which it was detected [credit Jon Lomberg]. Fumio Abe recently added a new string to MOA's bow wormhole-detecting methodology A wide-field infrared survey telescope (WFIRST) received top priority in the US 2010 decadal review for new space missions. WFIRST will study the accelerating expansion of the universe and search for worlds like Earth by gravitational microlensing. Dave Bennett led the submission on exoplanets.

MOA finally has a logo, thanks to Takashi Sako and Taka Sumi. The MOA and uFUN astronomy teams squared off at tennis at Mission Bay Tennis Club on 16 Nov 2008. MOA had the home court advantage and more supporters and narrowly won. Here are Phil Yock (MOA), Eike von Seggern (MOA), Yvette Perrott (MOA), Grant and Duncan Christie (uFUN) and Simon Yock (MOA) after the match. NZ Embassy . At a recent meeting of the AAS David Bennett announced the discovery of a planet orbiting a very low-mass star, probably a brown dwarf. The planet mass is also low, ~ 3x Earth mass. It was found in microlens event MOA-2007-BLG-192. Although the projected separation is about 0.6 AU, the planet could have a  thick atmosphere underlain by a deep ocean warmed by internal heating from radioactivity. Full details at arXiv:0806.0025 (Richard Kerr, Science, 15 Feb 2008, p. 885) A solar system that is similar to our own has been discovered by the gravitational microlensing community. The observation bodes well for there being a larger number of Earth-like planets than previously thought On 6 June 2007 NZ Post issued a “Southern Skies” set of stamps featuring well-known southern objects including the Southern Cross and the Large Cloud of Magellan, and also prominent telescopes.
