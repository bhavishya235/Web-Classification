Ju-Jitsu is a fantastic art and will keep you hooked for many years, enabling you to try variations on the art. Jujitsu, also known as Ju Jitsu, Ju Jutsu, and Jiu-Jitsu, is an ancient martial art used by the Samurai warriors of war-torn Japan. The art itself consists of punches, kicks, throws, ground-grappling, and weapons. Jujitsu techniques rely heavily on leverage, so you don't have to be extremely strong to train. Traditional Jujitsu or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu? This site provides you with the chance to learn traditional Jujitsu moves in the form of pictures and full descriptions. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a slightly modified version of the art, developed in Brazil by Helio Gracie where more emphasis is placed on takedowns and ground-grappling. We also have a whole section of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques , but still in the same format as our traditional jujitsu techniques. Ju Jitsu For Beginners We've now got a nice chunky section for beginners looking for more information on Ju-Jitsu and some of the terminology you may come across as you start training. Whether you want to know about the different Ju-Jitsu Belts or more information about the Ju-Jitsu uniform , we've got it all covered.

More information about the history of the Hontai Yoshin Ryu-Takagi Ryu lineage can be found in the archive section on our website: http://www.northlakesjujutsu.co.uk/archive.htm" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank'; The dojo is the headquarters of The North Lakes Jujutsu Association, an independent not for profit martial arts association based in Carlisle, and is the Motoha Yoshin Ryu headquarters for the UK under the supervision of the British Hombu-cho Andy McCormack. The North Lakes Jujutsu Association was founded in 1992 by Andy McCormack and training partner Martin Elliot, with the aims of furthering their study of traditional Japanese Jujutsu, and to promote authentic Japanese Jujutsu in Cumbria and the North. We were initially introduced to Yasumoto Soke as teenagers, when at that time (mid-1980s) as a Menkyo Kaiden teacher of Hontai Yoshin Ryu, Yasumoto sensei visited the UK teaching Hontai Yoshin Ryu Jujutsu to the World Jujitsu Federation. Since then the standard of jujutsu and the North Lakes Jujutsu Association has grown from strength to strength, and in 2008 the association opened the Nelson Street Dojo, that features a 132m2, matted training area, changing rooms showers, a full range of striking equipment (bags, pads, mok jong), members lockers, weight training equipment, and training weapons. Sessions run: Monday - Adults and older juniors - 7:30pm to 9:30pm Tuesday - Younger juniors (5+) 6:30pm to 7:30pm, Adults and older juniors 7:30pm to 9:30pm Wednesday - Black belt training by appointment Thursday - Adults and older juniors - 7:30pm to 9:30pm Friday - Adults and older juniors - 7:30pm to 9:30pm It is really w... 1 Replies | ( 0 | 0 ) 27 Jan 21:01 Vote this post up Vote this post down effective advertising submitted on Saturday 23 Nov by Fluffy_the_happy_lobster to General Jitsu Discussions Our club has just moved from being a split town/uni club to town only. This should allow us to advertise and put ourselves out there when we were previously unable to do so. It's been a change we've been considering for some time, but before we were able to make the call ourselves we encountered room and availability problems, which led to a tragic freshers showing, which led to the uni very quickly pulling the plug. After all, they were a bit desperate for the space. So, that leaves us with the town session (we had two sessions a week). So this leads me to my query, what have you found to be the most effective advertising? I don't want anything excessive; our club has around 8-13 on a mat each session and I'd like to increase this to about 12-18 per session. Beyond the website (which I need to revise), what do you suggest? What have you found that works well in the past? What is your average mat? This is our first solid foray into being a town-only club so are there any pitfalls to avoid? Many clubs, ours included, offer 1st session free deals. Do you think they really motivate folk to come down? Personally, I'm now of the view that for a town club, it doesn't.

Same as above but back-to-back is good, and last week I tried a Gracie game called Crazy Horse which the kids really loved - I will do this more now as it has many levels of difficulty Can anyone else suggest any games which have relevant JuJitsu learning within them, but are still seen as games by the kids? 3 Replies | ( 0 | 0 ) 11 Jan 19:01 Vote this post up Vote this post down SayĹ?nara submitted on Friday 08 Nov by rne02 to General Jitsu Discussions I think it is clear that the forum is (almost) dead, which is a shame as this was always one of the better and more sensible ones.

We're pretty sorted for that, but we also have the potential for a demonstration slot, and yet again we're prepared(ish), we need to see the demo area to make sure it's a viable proposition, but other than the normal risk assessment I think that we're good to go. We've been through this a few times before so there shouldn't be any issues.

The B.A.F was the first organisation with accreditation from the World Aikido Headquarters in Japan to teach Aikido in Britain was the Aikikai of Great Britain . It was founded in 1968 under the auspices of the Aikikai Foundation, and in 1977 was renamed the British Aikido Federation , with Minoru Kanetsuka (Shihan, 7th Dan, Aikikai Foundation) as its Technical Director. The B.A.F. has "Full Recognition" status from the Aikido World Headquarters, Tokyo and is a founder member of both the International Aikido Federation and the Joint Aikikai Council. The B.A.F is closely linked with the Aikido World Headquarters. Its technical advisor is Shihan Masatake Fujita (8th Dan, Hombu Dojo, Tokyo), and regular visits are made by senior Japanese instructors to conduct B.A.F. national courses. All dan grades (black belt holders) with the B.A.F. are recognised by the International Aikido Federation (I.A.F)and hold certificates issued by the Doshu, Moriteru Ueshiba. The structure of the B.A.F. teaching syllabus is closely based on that of the World Headquarters and not only proficiency of techniques but also correctness of manner and attitude is greatly emphasised. Kanetsuka Sensei and the Senior Instructors of the B.A.F conduct weekend courses throughout the year at Aikido centres all over the UK. The two major national courses: the Spring Course and the week-long Summer School have developed into international events attracting Aikido students from all over the world. Thanks to its world-wide connections the British Aikido Federation stands very much in the mainstream of Aikido development, and by virtue of its close ties with the fountain-head of Aikido (Hombu Dojo, Tokyo) it maintains an orthodox direction in its teaching and development. The original teaching of the Founder excluded any form of competition and emphasised the principles of non-aggression and harmony. The B.A.F. strongly maintains this attitude, and every effort is made to inculcate into our members the principles of non-violence and concern for others, both inside and outside the practice room.
