Housing Testimonial One of our self defense students recently had the unfortunate opportunity to put some of her training into use during a violent incident. Heres what she had to say about what she learned from Sun Dragon: I took the training at Sun Dragon probably 15+ years ago. It left an impression on me that should I end up in a violent situation I would be able to defend myself. Unfortunately, as a social worker, I did end up being attacked by a client. The principles I fell back on were the ones that I learned in this training. First trying to give a verbal command get off of me as the assault began. As the assault progressed I was able to not freeze (which is critical) but to defend myself until I could get help through a panic button in my office. Im quite certain that through learning self defense I was able to save my life and the life of my unborn child (as I was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of the assault). I want everyone I know to have this knowledge and training so that should they end up in a similar situation they also have the tools to respond. We are immensely gratified that we were able to impart knowledge to this woman that enabled her to safely protect herself and her unborn child until she was able to get help. This is exactly what self defense training is all about, and as has been illustrated by this story, these skills are useful for life.

Give yourself a tiny reward often, but only when you are in a good time management position. To control time well, try to discover the effort level required for all of your tasks. Skip on unimportant tasks and concentrate on the ones that tend to be more important. Devote your time to those goals that need to be completed immediately. Save your best work for the things which matters, and youll be happier as to what you accomplish. Create a list of the things you would want to do and order it based on importance. You need to go on working up until the list is performed, as youre capable of getting each task done. When you find it difficult to remember anything that appears listed, carry a copy of your own list together with you. Designate your daily tasks into four areas using a list. Your vertical columns should be labeled IMPORTANT and UNIMPORTANT. Next, draw a horizontal row and label using urgent and non urgent. Then, you can spend most of your time on the important and urgent tasks leaving a little portion of the day for the less urgent and unimportant tasks. Spend the vast majority of your time and effort around the quadrant labeled Be sure to remember those things in the non-important, non-urgent quadrants, too! What are the things that you wish to accomplish? If you want something done, you can find some time, they are saying. From the same token, you should let those things go that you dont have much wish to accomplish. Set time for what you like and you will definitely be described as a happier person.
