At 6-foot-4, Wall has good size for the position and he uses this to his advantage over his smaller peers. He is also highly explosive with great passing and the ability to drive to the lane and finish. His main problem is his jump shot, which is a frequent struggle. While he will continue to work on this weakness, it could be the difference between Wall being a very good player and a generational talent. real estate coach makes his pupils into better agents, Parker turns everyone on the floor into a better player. most three-pointers in a season and led the Golden State Warriors to a surprising playoff berth.

Having completed his rehabilitation from the Achilles tendon surgery he underwent last season, the Black Mamba returned to practice this past Saturday. While this technically means that Bryant is eligible to play in the Lakers next game, it is highly likely that he will ease back into the swing of things. Mamba Determination Although its tough to doubt Kobe Bryants famous willpower and determination, it would have been very difficult to anticipate the speed with which hes recovered from this injury. Considering the severe nature of a torn Achilles tendon, many people doubted that even one of the worlds toughest players would be able to recover ahead of schedule. Despite those long odds, this is exactly what Bryant did. He worked his way through rehabilitation with a determination and level of progress that surprised medical specialists and basketball fans alike. Rather than shying away from the obstacle that he faced, Kobe became very vocal on social media as he updated fans on his rehab process. Now after seven months of hard work for Bryant and anticipation from fans, the Lakers star is finally nearing his return to the court. First Practice Coaches, teammates and fans were excited to see Bryant return to 5 on 5 drills in his first real practice of the 2013-2014 season. This was the first time that Bryant had the chance to practice with his teammates this season and serves as a significant milestone in his recovery. A video of the practice displayed Bryant shooting jump shots and gave no indication of him favoring the injured left ankle as he ran. Despite these positive signs, it should be noted that the capacity with which Bryant participated was described as limited, according to Sports Illustrated . This stems from the fact that many of the drills were played at a 60% pace and the 5 on 5 drills did not involve intense defense. DAntoni Pleads for Patience As if Laker Nation wasnt already eagerly anticipating Kobes return, the news of his medical clearance has brought the hype to new heights. While coach Mike DAntoni is just as thrilled as everyone else to see Bryant retake the court, he is stressing caution. Ensuring that Bryant isnt feeling excess pain or soreness following practices and that he avoids setbacks are priorities for DAntoni, as cited by ESPN LA . He recognizes that Bryants return is a step-by-step process and that it shouldnt be rushed. Any kind of rehab can be difficult, and he surely is thankful to be over that step. Although it is a good sign to see his first practice go smoothly, it has yet to be seen whether his surgically repaired tendon is ready to handle the daily pounding that NBA players must endure. It has been suggested that Bryant will need at least two full weeks of practice and preparation before he can suit up for the purple and gold in a real game. While it seems that the news of Bryants return to practice may need to be taken with a grain of salt, its hard for Lakers fans to avoid getting excited. Regardless of whether or not he makes the November return that fans are hoping for, we seem to be getting very close to enjoying Bryants first game of the season.

Francisco Garcia after hitting a triple.Photo courtesy Bob Levey/Getty Images Alex Curtis-Slep 4:45 PM Links to this post Tuesday, October 29, 2013 2013-14 Preview of the Los Angeles Lakers team will fare this year. The previous injury-riddled campaign left most supporters of the purple and gold wanting more and wondering what could have been. With the high profile departure of Dwight Howard and the greatly anticipated return of Kobe Bryant, it is difficult to determine exactly how the Lakers will look this season. Below is a discussion of the new player acquisitions, returning stars and trends that Laker fans should look for this season. Kobe Bryant One of the best images for Lakers fans this preseason is that of Kobe Bryant running sprints up and down the sidelines and shooting jump shots. The injured star appears to be close to a full recovery from the Achilles tendon surgery that he underwent earlier this year. Without Bryant the Lakers were a glimpse of their former selves, barely making the playoffs and bowing out in the first round. Many skeptics point to Bryants age and the nature of his injury as factors that will keep him from playing up to normal Black Mamba standards this season. This preseason marked the first time in 10 years that Kobe was not ranked first in the annual General Managers poll for the best shooting guard in the league. Other Injury Returns Along with Bryant, the Lakers will be welcoming back Steve Nash and Jordan Hill from injuries that kept them out for much of last season. The 2012-2013 Lakers were far from healthy as they suffered injury blows to many significant players. This season, fans hope for the trend to be reversed, anticipating that a lineup featuring three former all-stars will go the distance. Defense A theme for last seasons Lakers was poor defense . Some teams have a defense thats formidable and engulfing like a police spike strip or a mosquito trap , eliminating all pests. The Lakers defense is more like a sieve. Struggling to keep up with teams in transition and to pressure the perimeter, it was common for the Lakers to give up triple digit scores to opposing teams. This year the addition of the aforementioned guards and frontcourt players will give the Lakers a presence both inside the paint and on the three-point arc. DAntoni hopes to blend this young athleticism with his veteran players to form an improved defensive unit. New Players Much of the Lakers depth going into this season comes in the form of young players and new acquisitions. During the offseason the Lakers picked up Nick Young, Xavier Henry, Jordan Farmar and Kaman. While Farmar is back for his second stint in L.A., Young and Henry will be playing their first season in a Lakers uniform. Coach Mike DAntoni will look for Young and Henry to serve as new scoring threats and Farmar will add depth to the point guard position. As for Kaman, he has a shot at earning a starting role at center in an effort to fill the void created by Howards departure. Kaman is a good defensive player and rebounder, two areas that the Lakers hope to improve in. accustomed to success. The Western Conference will be extremely competitive. Teams such as the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets have also added new talent in the offseason. With hopes of reaching the playoffs and progressing farther than last year, the Lakers will rely on the return of their injured core of stars as well as their promising new talent. --- Scott Huntington is a writer, reporter, blogger, and long-time sports fan.

Yao Ming Born in: China Years Played: 2002 - present NBA position: Center Height: 7'6" barefootor 2.29 m Weight: 310 lbs. or 140.9 kg In October of 2002, Yao was measured at 7'6" barefoot by NBA league officials. *Note that it has been reported in both Asia and Europe thatYao has since grown to 7'6 1/2" or 2.30m barefoot, which would actuallymake him the3rd player tallest in NBA history, and just 1/2" in height shorterthan Bol and Muresan. However, the last official NBA measurement from October of 2002, has not been updated, making verification impossible. Yao was measured at 7'5 1/2" (2.27m) prior to being drafted into the NBA. His 7'5" (2.26m) draft listing was a typographical error by the NBA, and later corrected to 7'5 1/2". http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/sports/feigen/2179901 " Department of weights and measures -- If the surge of Yao Ming dunks and power moves since last season makes him seem even bigger, that might be because he is. The Rockets did list Yao at 7-6 last season. But prior to the NBA draft, the NBA measured Yao at 7-5 1/2 and listed him at 7-5." Yao was also measured at 7'5 1/2" (2.27m) at the age of 19, prior to the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Syndey, Australia. http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/newswire/2000/09/18/141262065643_afp/ "SYDNEY, Sept 18 (AFP) - Members of the "Dream Team" think 20-year-old Chinese goliath Yao Ming has the skills to become China's first National Basketball Association player. The NBA stars got their first look at the 2.27m center and his fellow big men in China's "Walking Great Wall" here Sunday and taught them a valuable lesson - it's hard to stand tall sitting on the bench in foul trouble." Yao grew another1/2" to 7'6" even barefoot by October of 2002. Yao's wingspan at the time of his complete growth, according to the Houston Rockets,reached 7'5" (2.26m). Giving him the shortest wingspan among the NBA giants. 7'6" Yao 7'6" Yao (in red), and7'6" Bradley (in white), size each other up.

Chuck Nevitt Born in: US Years Played: 1982 - 1994 NBA position: Center Height: 7'5" barefootor 2.26 m Weight: 250 lbs. or 113.64 kg Nevitt was measured by the NBA at 7'5" (2.26m) barefoot. 7'7" Bol and 7'5" Nevitt It should be pointed out that over 90 percent of all NBA players in the modern league era are listed by their heights with shoes on. However, all NBA players have the option of being listed by either their height with shoes, or without shoes. In the cases of all 5 NBA giants above, they were listed by height without shoes. Chuck Nevitt, Yao Ming, and Shawn Bradley, all chose to be listed by their barefoot heights. Nevitt would have been listed at 7'6" with shoes, Yao at 7'7" with shoes, and Bradley at 7'7" with shoes, had they opted to be listed by the NBA at theirheight with shoes on. Bol and Muresan chose to be listed at their heights with shoes on. So Bol, who measured at 7'6 3/4" barefoot when he entered the NBA was listed at 7'7", his height with shoes, rounded down. Muresan was 7'6 1/2" when he entered the NBA, so he was then listed at 7'7", his height with shoes, rounded down. Bol grew another 1/4" to 7'7" even barefoot, and Muresan grew another 1/2" to 7'7" even barefootas well. Thus, their heights with shoes on, then should have beenupdated to 7'8" by the NBA. However, their heights were simply never updated by the NBA. So they too ended up being listed at their barefoot heights. Many people incorrectly believe that the heights for these 5 above playersare theirheights with shoes on, since that is how the vast majority of NBA players are listed. But in the cases of the 5 NBA giants above, they actually were/are listed by their barefoot heights. Above players are ranked in height based on their respective wingspans.
