<h2>Project Description</h2>

The SWALE project explores case-based reasoning (CBR) as a basis for
creativity.  In the CBR model of creativity, creativity comes from
retrieving knowledge that is not routinely applied to a situation, and
using it in a new way.  In this view, the key issues for creativity
are how to retrieve appropriate knowledge for novel uses and how to
adapt it to fit novel circumstances.  Depending on the retrieval and
adaptation processes used, CBR can provide solutions anywhere along a
spectrum of creativity, ranging from straightforward reapplications of
old knowledge all the way to highly novel views.

<P>The task in which the SWALE project studies creativity is creative
explanation of anomalous events.  SWALE is a story understanding
program that detects anomalous events and uses CBR to explain the
anomalies.  Its explanation process is based on the retrieval and
application of cases storing prior explanations, called <i>explanation
patterns</i> from its memory.  This case-based reasoning process can
take place at any point along the spectrum of creativity, from the
completely non-creative application of a perfectly appropriate XP, to
the very novel use of an inappropriate XP that must be totally revised
to be usable.

<P>The following illustrations of SWALE's reasoning are excerpted and
adapted from Schank, Roger C., and Leake, David B. Creativity and
Learning in a Case-Based Explainer.  <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>
40(1-3):353-385, 1989, and reprinted in Carbonell, J., ed, <i> Machine
Learning: Paradigms and Methods</i>, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1990.
A simplified version of the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~leake/cbr/code/">SWALE code</A>,
developed in scheme for pedagogical purposes, can be downloaded and
run to illustrate this process.

<h2>The Range of Explanations Generated by SWALE</h2>

In order to give an idea of the range of explanations that a system
using the case-based approach can generate, below are some remindings
that the SWALE system has, and a few of the explanations it generates
from them for its namesake example, the story of the racehorse Swale:
<UL>
<i>In 1984, Swale was the best 3-year-old racehorse, and he was winning
all the most important races.  A few days after a major victory, he
returned from a light morning gallop and collapsed outside his stable.
The shocked racing community tried to figure
out why.  Many hypotheses appeared, but the actual cause was never
determined.</i>
</UL>

<P>The SWALE system detects the anomaly in Swale's premature death
(see <A
HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/leake/papers/a-92-book.html">(Leake,
1992)</A> for a discussion of the system's anomaly detection
process).  It then builds explanations of the death by retrieving and
"tweaking" 
remindings of XPs for other episodes of death.  It picks the best of
these candidate explanations, and adds it to its XP library for future
use.  Some are reasonable explanations; others are quite fanciful or
can be ruled out on the basis of other knowledge.  However, they show
that a memory-based explanation system, even if it has a limited range
of XPs and of retrieval and tweaking strategies, can come up with a
variety of interesting explanations.

<UL>
 <LI>  <b>Reminding</b>  Thinking of other deaths of those in peak physical
       condition causes the system to be reminded of the death of the 
       runner Jim Fixx, who died when his running over-taxed a hereditary heart defect.

        <P><b>Explanation</b>  Swale might have had a heart defect that caused
       his racing to prompt a heart-attack.
 <LI>  <b>Reminding</b>  Thinking about other deaths of young stars, the system
       is reminded of Janis Joplin's death from a drug overdose.

        <P><b>Explanation 1</b>  The pressure of being a superstar was too much for
       Swale, and he turned to drugs to escape.  He died of an overdose.

        <P><b>Explanation 2</b>  Swale might have been given
       performance-enhancing drugs by a trainer, and died of an accidental
       overdose.
 <LI>  <b>Reminding</b>  Thinking of folkloric causes of death causes the system to
       recall the old wives' tale <i>too much sex will kill you</i>.

        <P><b>Explanation 1</b>  Although racehorses are prohibited from sex during
       their racing careers, Swale might have died of a heart-attack
       from the excitement of just thinking about life on the stud farm.

        <P><b>Explanation 2</b>  Swale might have committed suicide because he
       became depressed when thinking about sex.

        <P><b>Explanation 3</b>  Swale might have died in an accident when he
       was distracted by thinking about sex.
</UL>


<H2>Requirements for Creative Case-Based Explanation</H2>

<P>The above examples show that interesting explanations arise when we try
to use an XP that doesn't quite apply.  In order to obtain creative
explanations, an explainer might try to <i>intentionally misapply</i>
XPs.  Interesting ideas can arise from using old explanations to deal
with situations where those explanations were never intended to be used.

<P>While using an XP that doesn't apply gives a fresh perspective on a
situation, the idea of building a system to intentionally misapply XPs
raises many issues:  Which XPs do you retrieve?  Which tweaks should
be applied?  How long should the tweaking process be continued?  As our
research progresses, we hope to be able to answer these questions.
However, we can suggest some of the things that are needed to build
creative case-based explainers:
<UL>
<LI><B>We need heuristics for the intentional reminding of explanation
patterns</b> XP retrieval is the process of formulating questions to memory:
we characterize an anomalous situation in terms of a set of indices,
and ask what XPs in memory explain similar situations.  When no answer
is available, we must reformulate the question into one that we can
answer.  When no solution is
directly available, people often fall back on asking standard questions
that give background information.  Answers to <i>explanation questions</i>
like <i>what physical causes underlie this event?</i>, <i>what special
circumstances made the event happen now?</i>, <i>what motivates the actor
of this surprising action?</i>, <i>how did the victim enable this bad
event?</i>, or <i>what groups might the actor be trying to serve?</i>, may
suggest relevant factors that can be used as indices for XP retrieval.
Though the XPs accessed in this way might not be directly applicable,
it may be possible to adapt them.  A creative system needs a set of
explanation questions for gathering information, rules for selecting
which questions to apply in a given situation, and rules for transforming
them to fit.

<LI><B>We need tweaking strategies that can do significant revisions</b>
Tweaking must also be able to make significant revisions.  Rather than
requiring tweaks to always maintain causal structure, we should allow them
to make broad changes.  Their 
revisions will not always be successful, but failures produce new
possibilities for still more revision.  

<LI><B>We need heuristics for knowing when to keep alive seemingly useless 
hypotheses</b>
In addition to chosing between explanations generated by the system,
the evaluation process also has a more direct part in the creative process.
We cannot tweak a candidate explanation indefinitely; the evaluator must
decide whether a hypothesis is worth pursuing.  This estimation will
always be imperfect, but the better it is, the more resources the system
will be able to devote to fruitful revision of XPs.  One heuristic would
be to continue tweaking an explanation as long as each tweak generates
a better explanation.  But the decision whether to continue tweaking
should also depend on the availability of competing candidate XPs, and
on an estimate of how important the final explanation is to goals of
the system (since that affects how many resources should be expended
explaining).

<LI><B>We need a system with a rich memory of explanations</b>
Finally, a creative case-based explainer must have access to a wide range
of explanation patterns.  There are two ways that people or machines
might learn new XPs: by being taught them directly (as children are given
explanation patterns by parents, teachers, or friends), or by learning
new ones through creative misapplication. One step towards making a
computer creative would be to collect an extensive list of XPs that it
could use as the starting point for adaptation.  Many interesting
explanations might be constructed starting with a collection of
culturally-shared XPs, such as proverbs.

		<a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/" style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">William H. Calvin,</a> a professor 
at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, is the author of 16 popular books on science, 
mostly about brains, evolution, and climate change. They have been translated into 15 languages. 
He won the Phi Beta Kappa book prize for science as literature. 
His occasional magazine articles include an Atlantic Monthly cover story, "The Great Climate Flip-flop." 
His most recent books, starting with <i>Global Fever</i>, are about global overheating and what to do about it. 
<i>The Great Climate Leap</i> attempts a major reframing of how we view the climate threats. 
Our biggest problem is no longer future emissions and climate creep; 
it is the excess CO2 we already have and the climate leaps that have already begun. 
<i>The Great CO2 Cleanup</i> undertakes a major reframing of what we should be doing about them: 
a short-term massive cleanup of CO2 in addition to the emission reductions needed for the long term. 
"We have three big problems-overheating, ocean acidification, and abrupt climate shifts. It's a triple threat. 
Any menu of climate choices that ignores the second and third is a dangerous oversimplification. 
We are indeed fortunate that one set of undo actions-cleaning up the excess CO2-will address all three."

					The beyond-the-apes story starts about 7 million years ago. 
					To understand the emergence of mind -- and particularly the 
					higher aspects of consciousness that so set us apart from 
					the rest of the animal kingdom -- we need to understand what 
					the great apes are capable of. And what they don't do.&nbsp;<font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><a target="NEW" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226092011/thecalvinbookshe/">

					It is just in the last 1 percent of that up-from-the-apes 
					period that human creativity and technological capabilities 
					have really blossomed. It's been called &quot;The Mind's Big 
					Bang.&quot; In our usual expansive sense of &quot;mind,&quot; the history 
					of the mind is surprisingly brief, certainly when compared 
					with the long increase in brain size and the halting march 
					of tool making. What came before was not, as we usually 
					assume, a series of increasing approximations to the modern 
					mind. So what set the stage for this creative explosion?&nbsp;

			Coming on stage now is a stunning example of how civilization must 
			rescue itself. It dwarfs the three big scientific alerts from the 
			1970s about global warming, ozone loss, and acid rain. But until the 
			1990s, no one knew much about abrupt climate change, those past 
			occasions when the whole world flipped out of a warm-and-wet climate 
			like todays into the alternate mode, which is like a worldwide 
			version of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl of the 1930s. There are big 
			alterations in only 3-5 years. A few centuries later, the drought 
			climate flips back into worldwide warm-and-wet, even more quickly. 
			Unlike greenhouse warmings, the big flips have happened every few 
			thousand years on average, though the most recent one was back 
			before agriculture in 10,000 B.C. The next flip may arrive sooner 
			than otherwise, thanks to our current warming trend. The northern 
			extension of the Gulf Stream appears quite vulnerable to global 
			warming in four different ways. An early warning might be a decline 
			in this current. And according to two oceanographic studies 
			published this last year, this vulnerable ocean current has been 
			dramatically declining for the last 40-50 years, paralleling our 
			global warming and rising CO2.<br>

			The suite of higher intellectual functions includes syntax, 
			multi-stage planning, structured music, chains of logic, games with 
			arbitrary rules, and our fondness for discovering hidden patterns 
			(the search for coherence). It's likely that they share some neural 
			machinery for handling structure and judging coherence. But the 
			archeological record suggests that they are late-comers -- that the 
			three-fold enlargement of the ape brain into the human brain was 
			complete about 150,000 years ago, but that they were intensely 
			conservative, doing little that Neanderthals didnt do as well. The 
			&quot;behaviorally modern&quot; aspects were seldom seen before the Creative 
			Explosion about 50,000 years ago. So the big brain is not all about 
			intellect. What happened to reorganize the brain after 100,000 years 
			at its present size, to make it more creative and versatile, back 
			during the middle of the most recent ice age?<br>

			Bootstrapping Coherence using a Darwin Machine<br>
			<img border="0" src="LEMcvr.jpg" width="289" height="419" align="right" hspace="3"><br>
			The problem with creativity is not in putting together novel 
			mixtures  a little confusion may suffice  but in managing the 
			incoherence. Things often dont hang together properly  as in our 
			nighttime dreams, full of people, places, and occasions that dont 
			fit together very well. What sort of on-the-fly process does it take 
			to convert such an incoherent mix into a coherent compound, whether 
			it be an on-target movement program or a novel sentence to speak 
			aloud? The bootstrapping of new ideas works much like the immune 
			response or the evolution of a new animal species  except that the 
			neocortical brain circuitry can turn the Darwinian crank a lot 
			faster, on the time scale of thought and action. Few proposals 
			achieve a Perfect Ten when judged against our memories, but we can 
			subconsciously try out variations, using this Darwin Machine for 
			copying competitions among cerebral codes. Eventually, as quality 
			improves, we become conscious of our new invention. It's probably 
			the source of our fascination with discovering hidden order, with 
			imagining how things hang together, seen in getting the joke or 
			doing science. <br>
			<br>

			<p align="left"><b>Planning ballistic movements </b>as an 
			evolutionary setup for syntax<br>
			<br>
			For slow movements, progress reports can update the plan and correct 
			an approximate intention. But for ballistic movements that are 
			over-and-done in 1/8 sec, the feedback is too slow to correct the 
			movement; you have to make the perfect plan during get set. <br>
			We know that our ancestors were eating a lot of meat by about 1.8 
			million years ago. They had probably figured out how to bring down 
			big grazing animals, and with regularity. But accurate throwing (as 
			opposed to, say, the chimps fling of a branch) is a difficult task 
			for the brain. During get set one must improvise an 
			appropriate-to-the-target orchestration of a hundred muscles and 
			then execute the plan without feedback. While there are hundreds of 
			ways to throw that would hit a particular target, they are hidden 
			amidst millions of wrong answers, any one of which would cause 
			dinner to run away. Planning it right the first time, rather than 
			trying over and over, has real advantages. Just use the ballistic 
			movement planning circuits for other similar tasks in the spare 
			time. And what fits are the novel structured tasks of higher 
			intellectual function, such as syntax, contingent plans, polyphonic 
			music, getting the joke, and our search for how things all hang 
			together (seen in crossword puzzles and in doing science). Yes, some 
			of them pay their own way subsequently, but the free lunch seems 
			to be alive and well in the brain, where novel secondary uses 
			abound.<br>

<span class="intro">

In 1979, Douglas Hofstadter burst into public consciousness with a book so out of the ordinary it won a Pulitzer Prize for its young first-time author. Titled G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, it was a rambling 777-page magnum opus crowded with dense diagrams about feedback loops, witty parables about knowledge, and intellectual puns that had mathematicians in stitches. And it was all electronically typeset by its hackerish author. The book became a bestseller, and in the 1980s, it could be found on the bookshelves of anyone who had anything to do with the new fields of cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and computer science - although how many read it, or understood more than a third of it is unclear. But nearly every other author writing since in the same area has referred at least once to the legendary G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach.


<p>


As abruptly as Hofstadter burst on the scene, he disappeared. He began the book while a graduate student, and after its wild and unexpected success he went back to the lab and spent decades attempting to make his ideas work in real systems. He occasionally published his results in very technical journals, but he wrote little for the dedicated lay reader. Now, after 15 years, Hofstadter has published another major book. It is a technical tome, yet it still has humor: Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.


<p>


Those readers hoping for the witty high of G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach will be disappointed: this book is a workhorse. It attempts to lay out the elemental code of creativity - how a creative leap, no matter how small, is made. Hofstadter's ideas are, as usual, so original and so off-kilter that few yet know what to make of them. In his quiet way, Hofstadter is the most remarkable researcher in artificial intelligence today. He was interviewed by </cite>Wired<cite>'s Kevin Kelly.

<I>Wired</I>: Looking back, what would you say your first book, G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach, was really about?

<span class="question">
<font size=2 face="verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="#FF0000">

<p>

<span class="answer">
<font size=2 face="verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" color="#000000">
 I can see that many people didn't understand what the book was trying to do. Many people took it to be nothing but a title. They would look at the three words - G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach - and if they knew who these people were, they'd say, Oh, this is a book about mathematics, art, and music.


<p>


What G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach was really about - and I thought I said it over and over again - was the word I. Consciousness. It was about how thinking emerges from well-hidden mechanisms, way down, that we hardly understand. How not just thinking, but our sense of self and our awareness of consciousness, sets us apart from other complicated things. How understanding self-reference could help explain consciousness so that someday we might recognize it inside very complicated structures such as computing machinery. I was trying to understand what makes for a self, and what makes for a soul. What makes consciousness come out of mere electrons coursing through wires.


<p>


And yet many people treated the book as just some sort of big interdisciplinary romp whose point was simply to have fun. In fact, the fun was merely icing on the cake. Originally, the book was purely about the way the proof of G&ouml;del's theorem kept cropping up in the middle of a fortress - Principia Mathematica by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead - that was designed to keep it out. I thought, Here's a structure that attempts to keep out self-knowledge, but when things get sufficiently complex and sufficiently tangled, all of a sudden - whammo! - it's got self-representation in it. That to me was the trick that underlies consciousness. 


<p>


So, at first, there were no dialogs, no jokes, no wordplay, and no references to Escher or Bach. But as I typed the manuscript up in '74, I decided it was written in an immature style. I decided to insert the dialogs and the Escher so that the playfulness became a kind of a secondary - but extremely important - part of the book. 


<p>


Many people focused on those things and treated the book as a big game-playing thing. I had been aiming to have the book reach philosophers, people who thought about the mind and consciousness, and a small number actually saw what I was getting at, but most people just saw the glitter. At the time, I felt I'd lost a great deal by writing a book like that so early in my career, because I was no longer taken seriously by anybody.

<h3><a href="index.html">Consciousness In The Cosmos</a>: Perspective of
Mind: Douglas Hofstadter</h3>
<p>This posting will discuss the views of Douglas Hofstadter who is Professor
of Computer Science and Cognitive Science at Indiana University. </p>
<p>Hofstadter approaches the &quot;Mind&quot; from the perspective of the
computer sciences, in that there are both hardware and software aspects
of human intelligence. He looks at the enactment of intelligence in terms
of a formal system. In turn, Hofstadter declares that formal systems are
embedded. He infers that in relation to what we perceive as explicit in
a formal system, there is also an aspect that is intrinsically implicit.
</p>
<p>What about this idea of embedding, this something implicit enfolded into
formal systems? Formal systems may range from a football team to the Cosmos;
but in primal, natural systems, the idea of an embedded implicitness ultimately
suggests a &quot;Within&quot; in the heart of things. </p>
<p>To begin, there is a need for a descriptive presentation of Hofstadter's
brain system model. He uses the ant colony as an analogy of the human
brain system. This colony analogy permits Hofstadter to illustrate not
only the brain's hardware, but to carry through in describing the processes
leading from hardwiring to ideas about subsystems, agents, and complexity.
</p>
<p>Hofstadter relays that individual ants seem to be able to cooperate as
teammates and not randomly wander off. After billions of years of evolution,
these ants have passed a critical threshold...reinforcing themselves into
a collective behavior that results in an ant colony. Hofstadter likens
ant teams to signals; and, basically, &quot;the effect of signals is to
transport ants of various specialization to approximate parts of the colony.&quot;
Ultimately, the fully evolved ant colony takes on a holistic aspect, and
emerging molecular mechanisms take form. Douglas R. Hofstadter, GOEDEL,
ESCHER, BACH: AN ETERNAL GOLDEN BRAID, Vintage Books, 1979, pp. 315-316,
320.] </p>
<p>The colony's teams, its signals, are low-level active sub-systems of
a complex system. These signals trigger other signals. With this, Hofstadter
draws a similarity between these team signals and the human brain's neurons
and their interconnections and firings. The colony's team signals exist
according to a caste distribution; in the brain, there is no caste distribution...but
a counterpart can be found in what Hofstadter calls a &quot;brain state.&quot;
[Ibid, pp. 324-325] </p>
<p>Now Hofstadter leaps into the full system, whether it be the ant colony
or the brain. He believes that the full system is the &quot;agent,&quot;
that &quot;the full system is responsible for how its symbols trigger
each other.&quot; At this juncture, Hofstadter poses the question that
leads to the other side of his analogy. He ponders on the fact that a
single ant brain does not &quot;carry any information about nest structure;&quot;
and then he asks, &quot;how then does the nest get created...where does
the information reside?&quot; The above questions provide Hofstadter the
vehicle in which to launch his probe of the human brain; thus, he asks
how this brain carries out the processes of thinking, how it spawns intelligence?
[Ibid, pp. 327, 359] </p>
<p>Underlying everything in the hardwired brain is the reality of rules.
In the elementary constituents of the brain, down to the level of the
nerve cells, there is the presence of the rules. At this neural level,
at this sub-strate level of the brain, there can be no interpretation.
There is no imitation, because the rules in the brain's hardware are basic.
Hofstadter succinctly states, the brain &quot;has a formal, hidden hardware
level which is a formidably complex mechanism that makes transitions from
state to state according to definite rules embodied in it.&quot; [Ibid,
p. 559] </p>
<p>Intelligence resides in this brain hardware. Yet, it is of a *different
quality* so infers Hofstadter. Intelligence, although brain bound, &quot;can
be lifted right out of the hardware in which it resides...or in other
words, intelligence [can] be a software property.&quot; Hofstadter focuses
on the pivot that configures intelligence, mainly information and its
various expressions: such as words, stories, messages, and interpretations
of meaning. [Ibid, p. 358] </p>
<p>These expressions of meaning, in turn, make-up the software property
of the brain's intelligence. Some words, whose meaning is fixed, &quot;form
a rigid skeleton, giving an underlying structure to the system.&quot;
Other adjustable words, according to Hofstadter, fill in this skeleton
with meaningful material. These words evolve into stories that operate
on all levels of reality. Hofstadter observes that these stories can be
nested, operating within other stories. They, too, become embedded. [Ibid,
pp. 97, 184] </p>
<p>Out of stories come the messages and eventually the interpretation of
meaning. Hofstadter believes that information is intrinsically inside
the structure of these messages; he puts it thus, &quot;meaning resides
in the text, not in the method of decipherment.&quot; Meaning, however,
is a matter of interpretation. Our brains/minds contain interpreters;
these interpreters, according to Hofstadter, are a &quot;pulling-out mechanism
of inner meaning.&quot; He continues, noting that much of the source of
mental images, or eventual intuitive meaning, is &quot;like an iceberg...deep
underwater, unseen.&quot; [Ibid, pp. 164, 582, 713] </p>
<p>The brain is hardwired according to implicit, basic rules. Hofstadter
believes that these embedded rules allow the potential for a flexibility
and transitional capability to an almost infinitely complex level. Harkening
back, through a long evolutionary journey, the compelling inner codes
of DNA have written the rules for the brain as hardware. In turn, the
discoveries of modern bioscience suggest an *underlying order* lodged
in the DNA. </p>
<p>However--when we reach out beyond the rules that formed our hardwired
brain, when we move from hardware to software, we run into rules that
can seem to be playfully creative and changing. As Hofstadter puts it,
&quot;rules that change themselves, directly or indirectly, are at the
core of intelligence.&quot; For Hofstadter there must be some kind of
&quot;imaginable world, a world where the only restriction is that in
it...logic should be the same as in our world.&quot; [Ibid, pp. 27, 99,
362] </p>
<p>Hofstadter demands an external consistency from this world behind the
rules; and, he believes that this implicit world is truly there! Throughout
his treatment of intelligence, of thinking, he harkens back to that sense
of a deeply embedded, creative implicitness in the software aspects of
intelligence. </p>
<p>Actually, Hofstadter pours forth a gamut of statements suggesting this
sense of creative implicitness in the brain system's software. He alludes
to the endless potential of creativity, when he observes that &quot;our
minds contain interpreters which accept two-dimensional patterns and then
pull from them high-dimensional notions which are so complex that we cannot
consciously describe them.&quot; Commenting on the Strange Loops of hierarchial
levels of thinking...that phenomenon of moving up and down through the
levels and arriving where we began...Hofstadter intuitively senses at
bottom there is &quot;something mathematical involved here.&quot; Or to
put it another way, there is something logically creative here. [Ibid,
pp. 15, 161-162, 582.] </p>
<p>Strange Loops are a kind of iteration, and there is also a correspondence
to be found in fractal geometry. Fractals can be generated by iteration.
Fractal geometry shows that shapes have self-similarity at descending
scales. Is this not like arriving at the same point at different levels?
The iterations of Strange Loops could also be compared with those present
in the feedback cycle of chaos and order. </p>
<p>Strange Loops, feedback cycles, and iterations are mechanisms of the
creative complexity of intelligence; they are, for Hofstadter, the retrieval
mechanisms of inner meaning. </p>
<p>But what is this inner meaning behind the mechanics of intelligence,
behind the sense of something implicit embedded deeply in the brain system?
For the great mathematician Kurt Goedel, from whom Hofstadter draws, it
is a universal, nonlocal Mind. [Rudy Rucker, INFINITY AND THE MIND, p.
183.] </p>
<p>Perhaps Hofstadter could not say outright that the brain/Mind is a vessel
for the expression of a Cosmic Ground, but he points his finger in that
direction. Discussing perception, Hofstadter quietly says that &quot;by
gradually widening the scope of the brain/Mind system, one will in the
end come to a feeling of being at one with the entire universe.&quot;
[Hofstadter, GOEDEL, ESCHER, BACH, p. 479] </p>
<p>If it were possible that the brain/mind system might be a vessel for
cosmic expression, where might this scenario lead? Hofstadter contends
that Strange Loops move us into greater consciousness. While pondering
the emerging sense of self, he puts it thus: </p>
<p>&quot;My belief is that the explanation of emergent phenomena in our
brains...for instance ideas, hopes, images, analogies, and finally consciousness
and free will...are based on a kind of Strange Loop, an interaction between
levels in which the top level reaches back towards the bottom level and
influences it, while at the same time being itself determined by the bottom
level.&quot; [Ibid, p. 709] </p>
<p>The above quote likens Strange Loops to a spiral in which at ever expanding
higher levels, there exists the capability to suck-up continuing information
input from the bottom, more basic level. And, as previously mentioned,
these Strange Loops can also be compared to a feedback cycle of continual
enfoldment and unfoldment. </p>
<p>Finally, Hofstadter does show a tendency towards the direction of a &quot;Noosphere&quot;...a
single brain/Mind system of the human species. After all, the concept
of a Noosphere is really not too afar afield from Hofstadter's analogy
of the ant colony. If he were ever to outright address the conjectures
of a Noosphere, Hofstadter might employ his beautiful thoughts about wholes,
of totalities, as exemplified in his marvelous statement on the fugue:
</p>
<p>&quot;Fugues have that interesting property, that each of their voices
is a piece of music in itself; and thus a fugue might be thought of as
a collection of several distinct pieces of music, all based on one single
theme, and all played simultaneously...each of these individually meaningful
lines fuse with the others in a highly non random way, to make a graceful
totality.&quot; [Ibid, p. 283] </p>

<p> <img src="/images/y.gif" align=left alt=Y>OU'RE LOOKING AT A NEWSPAPER comic page and your eye falls on today's jumble. It's an anagram puzzle. You have to turn a few scrambled letters into a word. LOONDERK. A tough one. KRONDOLE. KNOODLER. Close. Patterns form and re- form in your mind. Actually, in this case there isn't even a word there, but at least the patterns look like words. Implausible combinations like EOKDNLRO and NRDOEOKL never leap to mind. This isn't like doing arithmetic - there are no rules to tell you how to make these patterns. No conscious logic decides how to tear the letters apart and put them back together. It just happens, with a delicacy that belies the power of the decision making. The regrouping is fast, subtle and fluid.  
<p>
Or so it is when Douglas R. Hofstadter, computer scientist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, does Jumbles. ''I have an unbelievably rapid way of exploring the space,'' he says, writing KNOODLER on his blackboard at Indiana University. ''These words just appear in front of me. Then something else appears, or two or three things, over and over again, new possibilities and new combinations - and always English sounds or close to them.'' He looks at the letters. A grin appears and disappears under a mass of unruly black hair. ''I don't make any conscious decisions - I don't say, well let me try this, let me try that. Instead, instantly, the whole word is built in my mind - like that.'' 
<p>
In the blossoming field of artificial intelligence, where scientists are trying to make computers simulate sophisticated human abilities, Hofstadter's colleagues have little interest in trivia like Jumbles. Many of them are working on expert programs that can prospect for oil or diagnose diseases, and they have made great and well-publicized strides that just a few years ago would have seemed inconceivable. It's no longer astounding to hear about computers imitating anything from a psychiatrist to a schizophrenic. Yet some of the abilities that add up to intelligence - abilities as simple as recognizing the letter A, or predicting the next number in a sequence (1-2-2-3-3-3-?), or doing Jumbles - have stayed as mysterious as ever. Generally, what people can do without thinking, computers cannot do at all.
<p>
So Hofstadter is writing a computer program that will try to unscramble Jumbles. In one way, it's a trivial problem. It would be easy to let a computer solve Jumbles by mechanically listing every possible permutation of the letters and checking the results against a dictionary of English words. A program like that, relying on raw, stupid computing power, wouldn't even qualify as artificial intelligence - it would be like untying shoelaces with a buzz saw. Hofstadter wants his program to do its thinking the same way he does, deep below the level of consciousness, without logic but with fluidity. He wants a program with an understanding of how words are put together - a program that won't waste a millisecond on ODKNRLEO, but will pause seriously to consider KNOODLER. Above all, he wants the mental juggling and the flash of inspiration.
<p>
With his Jumbles and with some other programs, equally unprepossessing, Hofstadter is reaching for the very heart of thinking. He is trying to simulate not the most sophisticated thought processes, but the most basic. His developing theory of the mind - and it is a real theory, although his conversation and his writings often seem as wild and multidirectional as a fireworks display - has begun to draw a wide following through two successful books, including ''G"odel, Escher, Bach,'' and a monthly magazine column, with a collection of essays to come in late 1984. And Hofstadter, in lectures around the country and in an especially provocative paper not yet published, has also begun causing a stir in the academic world - not in his own field, where his ideas are far from popular, but among some philosophers of mind, who believe he is claiming a territory all his own at the increasingly busy crossroads of artificial intelligence, neuroscience and philosophy.
<p>
The three fields are coming together as never before, providing new approaches to some of the most fundamental questions of how the mind works. When you think about yourself, what is being thought about and what is doing the thinking? Can machines be taught the most human of human traits - creativity, inspiration, imagination? How does a brain of neurons and synapses come to be aware of itself as a mind? In seeking answers to such questions, Hofstadter - a 38-year-old associate professor of computer science with a background in mathematics and physics, a love of music and language and a weakness for puns - is an unlikely philosopher. But in his own modern way, he is reinventing the human soul.
<p>
''A lot of people believe that there is nothing going on when you perceive,'' Hofstadter said, stepping away from his blackboard to a desk covered with papers and unanswered mail. ''They say: 'I see a book there. It's instant! It doesn't take any time at all! There can't be any processing or computing going on there. It's just obvious.' '' Yet whatever unconscious process manages such tasks is so subtle and so powerful that it has eluded the best efforts of artificial intelligence. ''Memory, too,'' he said. ''To see something you haven't thought of for years float effortlessly to the surface of the mind is a great mystery.'' 
<p>
When Hofstadter looks at KNOODLER, so frustratingly close to a word and so unexpectedly elegant that he is reluctant to take it apart and try something else, it reminds him of a summer day in 1966 when he looked in all the streets and shops of a small Danish fishing town and then stood waiting for a friend on a long and beautiful pier - reluctant to give up and look elsewhere. Somehow the two moments, separated by 17 years, had exactly the same emotional flavor. ''But when you try to describe the connection,'' he said, ''it's unbelievably abstract - so abstract you couldn't in 10 years get a program to see the connection.'' There are no conscious rules for it, just as there are no conscious rules for retrieving a tip-of-the-tongue piece of memory that is just out of reach. But some part of the mind is doing some very hard work.
<p>
Perception. Memory. Analogy. Regrouping. ''Abilities to do very simple things, to take things apart and put them back together again in new ways, that's so much at the root of creativity,'' Hofstadter said. ''When a composer like Bach composed fugues, you can practically see the wheels churning. You can see Bach taking things apart and putting them back together - you can see that incredible fluidity.'' He is trying to build that same fluidity into his computer programs, by organizing them the way he believes the human mind must be organized.
<p>THESE ARE VERY EXCITING times in philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence and the neurosciences, which are also exploding,'' said Paul M. Churchland, professor of philosophy at the University of Manitoba. He has been working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where Hofstadter addressed a conference early this spring.
<p>
''In the last 10 years, maybe only in the last two years, they've seriously discovered one another, and Hofstadter is doing a great deal to make it one great interactive ball of activity. So much that the suspicion is that there are three Doug Hofstadters working in cycles to produce all the work he does.'' 
<p>
The challenge presented by the revolution in artificial intelligence is to show how one might create a mechanical model for the mind - and not just any model, but one that expresses all our wonder at the spark of human inspiration and the power of human will. Although that is a distant goal for computer scientists, many philosophers are intrigued by theories that have already begun to develop out of their work. For anyone, in fact, who thinks about thinking, the ferment is turning these fields into a lively spectator sport.
<p>
There are plenty of spectators. Hofstadter's first book on these matters, ''G"odel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,'' published by Basic Books, won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and then went on to indisputable distinction as the hardest-to-read book ever to spend five months on the trade paperback best-seller list. The book was initially turned down by several publishers, including Indiana University Press, where a reader called it ''a formidable hodgepodge,'' and it was widely misunderstood even by some reviewers who admired it. It's no wonder. The book is a richly woven enigma, exploring Bach's fugues, M. C. Escher's drawings and Kurt G"odel's notorious
Incompleteness Theorem, the ultimate spoilsport of modern logic, which declares that any attempt to build a complete and consistent logical system will inevitably be ruined by undecidable propositions. Riddled with wordplay, mixing mathematical discursions with fanciful dialogues, ''G"odel, Escher, Bach'' carries readers through the central problems of contemporary philosophy of  mind.
<p>
The book has sold well over 300,000 copies in hard cover and paperback, and is now bringing sweat to the brows of translators in Japanese and a half- dozen European languages. Hofstadter has also continued to reach thousands of readers in an unusual Scientific American column devoted, apparently, to nothing more or less than the idiosyncratic world view of Douglas Hofstadter. His publisher, Martin Kessler of Basic Books, plans to bring out a collection of his essays next year - ''precisely,'' as Kessler put it, ''in order to define what might be called the Hofstadter perspective.''
<p><p>
Despite his enormous popular appeal - and in some cases, because of it - Hofstadter has put himself at odds with the more practical segment of his own field of artificial intelligence. He is well aware that academics tend to mistrust new ideas arriving in splashy guises. But he persistently plays up to that prejudice by filling his writings with talking animals, bizarre coinages and more than any man's fair share of bad puns. It doesn't help that he writes scholarly articles with titles like ''Who Shoves Whom Around Inside the Careenium?'' in the form of dialogues between Achilles and Tortoise - favorite Hofstadter characters borrowed, via Lewis Carroll, from an ancient Greek paradox of infinity. Nor did it help that he wrote Scientific American's cover story on Rubik's Cube, just before it became a pop culture craze.
<p>
Hofstadter has also become a player in a profound debate that is taking shape in artificial intelligence, between technologists and scientists, between the pragmatic and the theoretical. Some programmers have managed to keep a foot in each door. But many have turned from pure science to programs that accomplish a specific high-level task, successfully simulating some piece of intelligent behavior. These ''expert'' programs are best suited to meeting the immediate needs of industry, and many computer scientists have left the universities to join private companies with names like Symbolics and Teknowledge.
<p>
In the meantime, there is much disagreement inside and outside of the technical community about just what computers can do. ''These are days of hype about computers,'' Hofstadter said. ''People are being asked to change overnight from a view of computers as basically stupid to the idea that computers are our partners in evolution. Not enough people are saying, wait a minute, how do we really think, what is consciousness, where does our sense of self come from.'' 
<p>
None of which is to dispute the value of the less theoretical contributions in the field. After all, the development of the jet plane may not have contributed much to our theoretical understanding of how birds fly, but it hasn't been without a certain practical utility.
<p>
If any one person was responsible for the growth of artificial intelligence over the last decade, it was Marvin Minsky, Donner Professor of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where the computer science department has suffered heavily from the lure of industry. Minsky, a pioneer in the field since before it had a name, describes the new debate in terms of what might be called the Bird's Nest Problem.
<p>
Like Hofstadter, Minsky has a vision of artificial intelligence striving to simulate the mind in all its richness. He regrets the preference of many in his field for programs that can do commercially useful ''performance'' tasks that seem complicated but sidestep the most fundamental problems. Such programs can be refined endlessly and taught ever- fancier tasks, but they remain too stolid to adjust to the kind of unpredictability that the real world is so fond of throwing in our paths. An inspired chess- playing program might be able to trounce a good player, but change the rules a little - let knights move twice, or let pawns move backward, or make the board 9 by 9 - and the machine will be at sea, while the human player will manage to cope.
<p>
Expert systems are by no means the whole story of artificial intelligence these days. Many scientists have continued to work on issues of language, of learning, of planning. But none have managed to teach a machine to handle the variation and complexity of real life. That's the Bird's Nest Problem. 
<p>
''Nobody's ever tried to make a machine that could build a bird's nest,'' Minsky said. ''Instead they're all out there in factories assembling motors. People say, oh yes, the bird gets straws and it sticks them in the nest and glues them in. But a motor is designed to be put together. The debris lying around on the floor of a forest isn't designed to be made into nests.'' 
<p>
Industry needs programs that work now, not programs that point the way to a cognitive science of the future. And the quickest way to make a program accomplish a sophisticated task is to write a sophisticated set of instructions for the computer to follow, step by step, one after another. An expert system takes a particular kind of expert behavior - medical diagnosis, for example - and imitates it, with the help of rules abstracted from the way people perform the same tasks. A diagnosis program might tell the computer to begin with certain questions, just as a doctor would. Then a particular response might guide the computer to a particular set of follow-up questions. The paths of questions and answers can go in an intricate variety of directions.
<p>
The patient's responses can be analyzed against a data base containing information about vast numbers of diseases. A world of medical experience can be written in, and the results can be truly impressive. They are leagues beyond the routine programs used by scientists and businesses for calculating, sorting or filing. But they don't match the creativity of even the most pedestrian doctor. 
<p>
''The problem is,'' said Roger C. Schank, head of Yale University's artificial intelligence laboratory, ''what you've done at that point is just written down a set of rules. You haven't got a system that can then form its own rules. What you get now are machines that are intelligent enough to do some stuff, but not intelligent enough ever to surprise you.''
<p>
Schank, who has also formed a private company, Cognitive Systems, agrees that expert systems are leaving the most important issues of intelligence untouched. He believes the answer is to keep writing rules, but more flexible ones - rules that will tell the computer how to learn and change. As long as programmers provide the rules, however, the problem of predictability seems inescapable. All the initiative, all the goal setting, all the things that resemble free will come from outside the machine.
<p>
Hofstadter describes a different approach, based on his view of the subconscious processes of our own minds. Reasoning comes not first but last. Instead of beginning with an overall algorithm, or set of rules, he begins with many small pieces of computer code acting almost independently. ''You don't write the thinking algorithm. It's not that you dictate from on high, first this will happen, then this will happen and so on.  ''What you do is, you write a 
lot of algorithms for little teeny structures and then you allow them to interact in a certain way. You also write the algorithm for how they interact, but you let them, in some sense, swim and interact together. In essence, you let them nondeterministically interact with each other, and it's the sum total of how they work together that creates intelligence.''
<p>
In the anagram program, which he calls ''Jumbo,'' one tiny part - a ''spark'' - might pick a couple of letters and put them together. Simultaneously another spark might be looking at other letters, or groups of letters.
<p>
Meanwhile, a higher-level part - a ''flash'' - might be checking a couple of sparks. ''There are quick tests for affinity and slightly longer tests for affinity. You can imagine such tests at all levels.''
<p>
All the time, groups of letters might be formed and broken apart again until gradually, out of the simultaneous swimming together of the many parts, a pattern begins to emerge. No one is telling the computer to create a certain kind of pattern. No one knows exactly what kind of pattern will be created. It just happens.
<p>
Or would, if the program worked as well as Hofstadter hopes it will. So far, it doesn't, and most of his colleagues - including Schank - believe that they are on firm ground in viewing his approach with skepticism.
<p>
But some, like Minsky, believe that history will be on Hofstadter's side. They argue that expert systems, no matter how impressive they seem, will be a dead end, never learning to find the deep connections between concepts, recognize patterns, carry tasks beyond the instructions set for them. 
<p>
''Somebody's got to spend a few years asking just what does it take to do the things we take for granted,'' Minsky said. ''That's what Hofstadter is doing. He's one of those people of whom, 50 years from now, they'll say he was on the right track and they should have listened more.
<p>
''Hofstadter's philosophical ideas on how the mind works are just about the best in the world today,'' Minsky said. ''He's laying out the future - and people are not reacting because there are too many details to do first.'' 
<p>
WHEN HOFSTADTER IS home in Bloomington, he rides his bicycle between a cluttered Indiana University office and his even more cluttered house, where he lives alone. As any Hofstadter reader would instantly see, the clutter is the same stuff that spills off every page of his writing. Escher reproductions on the walls. Bach and Chopin scores on the piano. Dozens of Rubik's Cubes and cube spinoffs, including a 5-by-5-by-5 version that he is not quite ready to scramble. Tortoises everywhere: porcelain tortoises, metal tortoises, wooden tortoises, even a tortoise footstool on which Hofstadter perched happily when I went to see him. ''It's a friendly beast,'' he said.
<p>
His living-room floor was piled with letters from readers. He gets 40 to 60 a week, mostly in packets forwarded by Scientific American. A minister wrote enclosing a sermon he had delivered about ''G"odel, Escher, Bach.'' A photographer said he had bought a Chopin recording after reading Hofstadter's column on Chopin and the spirit of Poland. But most were just people asking for guidance on questions as simple and as profound as one at the top of the pile, from a man suddenly struck with helpless curiosity about the nature of the difference between right and left.
<p>
''They all want me to say something to them - why is the universe the way it is,'' Hofstadter said. He cannot begin to answer them all, but he has been in love with such mysteries all his life.
<p>
Douglas Richard Hofstadter was born in New York City on Feb. 15, 1945, and grew up near Stanford University, where his father, the Nobel Prize- winning physicist Robert Hofstadter, still teaches. ''As a child growing up in a family where physics was being done, I was incredibly absorbed by words like photon and neutrino,'' Hofstadter said. ''I thought the most exciting thing in the world would be to be an antineutrino - the idea was too mysterious for words. And from the beginning I was fascinated by numbers - each number, it seemed, had some kind of magical property, and there was a sense of mysticism about it all, of being in tune and in touch with God.''
<p>
He threw himself into mathematics and languages and later the piano. When he was still in high school, and computers were two decades away from becoming a household item, he managed to get access to Stanford's. ''I was a cocky young kid, and if I could push the button, I would sneak in there and do it. I'd have my program on cards, put them in the hopper and watch the line printer chunking along. Chunk, chunk.''
<p>
Hofstadter went to Stanford, graduating in 1965, and eventually began a miserable struggle with his father's specialty, particle physics, at the University of Oregon. By the time he got his doctorate, he knew he was no physicist. ''I was a recursion- crazed mathematician who happened to have found the right problem in physics, and I began training myself to be an A.I. person: what I had always been if I had been paying attention.'' He was also already writing out in pen what eventually became ''G"odel, Escher, Bach.''
<p>
The book was published in 1979, and its huge popular success astonished both Hofstadter and Basic Books, which had brought out a modest first printing of 5,000. It did little for Hofstadter's relations with the orthodox academic world. ''When 'G.E.B.' started appearing on the paperback best seller list, I was pleased and appalled - appalled because it was making my name mud in academia. My chief rivals were 'The Joy of Sex' and a book on how to have thinner thighs. Then there was a Tom Robbins book, 'Still Life With Woodpecker' - for weeks he and I jockeyed back and forth. It was a terrible case of mixed feelings. I wanted to get ahead of him, but at the same time I was ashamed of being on the list.''
<p>
''I never expected the cult reaction,'' he said. ''The reaction from fans, fanatics. And yet I never expected that it would be so ignored by A.I. people. I've felt very cold-shouldered by the A.I. world.
<p>
''A lot of people in A.I. come from a mathematics or logic background. They're interested in deduction, and they're bewitched by the glitter of a fancy expert system.''
<p>
For philosophers who believe that intelligence can be mechanized, a stumbling block has always been the question of who will be doing the programming for an intelligent computer - when a machine is thinking, who is telling it what to think? Where is the ''I''? It is a machine version of one of the most ancient philosophical conundrums - a mind-body problem in the tradition of Plato and Descartes.
<p>
Some philosophers of mind have lately become fascinated with a possible road to an answer, beginning with the fundamental problems that have persistently defied programmers. Take the letter A. Hofstadter has hundreds of them on his office wall, in a poster cataloguing a variety of typefaces. They are all different, but they are all A's. How to recognize letters in any of the many shapes they can take was one of the classic early problems of artificial intelligence. But it was largely abandoned in favor of programs that could read a narrow range of specially designed characters, like the numerals on bank checks. The computer program has not yet been written that can tell any recognizable A from any B.
<p>
What is an A, anyway? The basic form buried in most people's minds seems to be a pair of slanting uprights and a crossbar. Yet people identify A's in limitless incarnations, with curved lines or broken lines or double lines, with flourishes and curlicues, upside-down or sideways, black-on-white or white-on- black, with or without uprights and crossbar. The process is instantaneous, and it is easy to suppose there is nothing to it - until you try to teach a machine to do it. In a real sense, to solve the letter- recognition problem would be to solve the whole problem of perception.
<p>
More than that, the exploration of processes below the level of conscious thought may begin a path to the deeper problems of mechanizing inspiration and self- awareness. That is the prospect that so tantalizes philosophers. 
<p>
Some of these issues are raised in a new paper by Hofstadter with the uncharacteristically forgettable title ''Artificial Intelligence: Subcognition as Computation.'' It will not be published until fall, but copies have already percolated through several layers of the academic world, stirring special interest among some philosophers of mind.
<p>
''It impressed me enormously,'' said Churchland of the University of Manitoba. ''It turned around in one fell swoop any tendency I might have had to think of Doug as a popularizer. He's standing back a few steps and taking a large look at the course of A.I., remarking on where its successes have come and where the frustrating failures have come. And he has offered a suggestion on how the barrier might be broken through.''
<p>
Hofstadter argues that artificial intelligence has been caught up with mimicking logic and deduction, at the expense of the more mysterious processes of subcognition. It is a sharp critique. ''It is my belief,'' Hofstadter says, ''that until A.I. has been stood on its head and is 100 percent bottom-up, it won't achieve the same level or type of intelligence as humans have.'' 
<p>
Needless to say, in the artificial intelligence world, the paper's reception has not been warm.
<p>
The response from the technical community generally runs something like this: Hofstadter has demonstrated no useful working program. He makes strong claims about where true intelligence will and will not be found, but does not back them up with technical work. He offers theories that appeal to philosophers, but philosophers do not have the same need for scientific proofs.
<p>
One particularly successful scholar of artificial intelligence is Allen Newell of Carnegie-Mellon University. ''He's trying to make the case that intelligence is somehow emergent out of the lower- level stuff,'' Newell said. ''But I don't think he has produced a technical sort of proposal there to support the rhetoric.''
<p>
In Newell's view, the current approach to his field is succeeding - it is where almost all the progress has been made. Hofstadter's approach, he says, is plausible, but only plausible. ''One can certainly have the hypothesis,'' he said. ''And in fact that may be right. But I don't know of any evidence for it in the way Doug talks about it in that paper. He wasn't actually providing enough technical stuff.
<p>
''There's a coin of the realm in A.I. with respect to running programs that demonstrate things. And of course that attitude doesn't exist in philosophy - philosophy has its own ethos.''
<p>
It is true that philosophers, even those drawn to the ideas coming out of computer science and artificial intelligence, do not place a high premium on experimental proofs. ''Psychology never has been and never will be like physics,'' said Judson C. Webb, a philosopher and logician at Boston University. ''Most questions you don't have a ghost of a chance of ever settling by experiment.''
<p>
Still, to scientists like Newell and like Schank at Yale, a working demonstration would be more convincing than mere theorizing, and the undeniable fact is that Hofstadter is not putting forward working programs. ''Maybe Hofstadter is a philosopher,'' Schank said, ''but you can't say such a person is an A.I. person. He's a popularist.''
<p>
''Actually,'' said Webb, ''other people think that about Schank. Artificial intelligence is a curious field, I must say - it's often difficult to distinguish the cranks and the geniuses. But Hofstadter has a fertile, seminal mind, and the ideas he deals with have attracted the attention of philosophers more and more.''
<p>
Even so, the criticism within his chosen field has rankled Hofstadter ever since ''G"odel, Escher, Bach,'' which he believes was misunderstood by laymen and professionals alike.
<p>
''It does not seem like a technical contribution,'' he said. ''It does not seem like a working program. It does not seem like a set of theorems. It does not seem like a set of proposals for how a program should be organized. What saddens me is that so many A.I. people seem trapped in their already-formed modes of thought and their preconceptions. They tend to eschew the whole question of what consciousness means. They avoid the questions of philosophy
of mind.''
<p>
The book drew the attention of a few philosophers early on. Raymond Smullyan, a philosopher and logician at the City University of New York, shares Hofstadter's delight with paradox and puzzle-making, and he believes the book will have a lasting effect on the way people think about the mind. ''It may not have been academically influential,'' he said, ''but it is culturally influential.''
<p>
Several of the major philosophical journals have now reviewed the book. ''It weighs in to a very juicy area,'' said Boston University's Webb, who has prepared a long and appreciative review for the Journal of Symbolic Logic. 
<p>
The academic grapevine that brought Churchland the subcognition paper went by way of Daniel C. Dennett, professor of philosophy at Tufts University and a former president of the Society for Philosophy and Pyschology. He first met Hofstadter in 1980, in Stanford, Calif., where they were both studying artificial intelligence - Hofstadter as a Simon F. Guggenheim fellow at Stanford University, Dennett as a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. By then, of course, Dennett knew of ''G"odel, Escher, Bach.''
<p>
''My initial bias,'' he recalled, ''was that a book with that title and that subtitle couldn't possibly be any good, that it would be a sort of West Coast, oh wow book. But of course it isn't anything of the kind. It's an amazingly rich and intricate book.''
<p>
Out of their conversations at Stanford came a collection, called ''The Mind's I: Fantasies and Reflections on Self and Soul,'' of pieces by novelists, scientists and logicians with commentaries by Hofstadter and Dennett. It has sold well over 100,000 copies in hard cover and paperback. Since then Dennett has followed Hofstadter's work closely, most recently citing it this spring in a series of lectures at Oxford University on free will.
<p>
''He develops ideas that have been bandied about by philosophers for years, but nobody has done it with the depth and the care and the detail, and nobody has exploited the idea as richly as Hofstadter,'' said Dennett. ''He has found a way of characterizing the contribution of the computer metaphor to the understanding of the mind which is realistic and flexible and not ideological and programmatic.
<p>
''To philosophers who think that's the way to go in solving the mysteries of the mind, Hofstadter's work is as sophisticated as anything anybody's done. In fact, that's something of a bandwagon these days, and to get on that bandwagon you've got to pay attention to Hofstadter.''
<p>
Hofstadter has no shortage of metaphors for the mind. An ant colony. A labyrinth of rooms, with endless rows of doors flinging open and slamming shut. A network of intricate domino chains, branching apart and rejoining, with little timed springs to stand the dominoes back up. Velcro-covered marbles bashing around inside a ''careenium.'' A wind chime, with myriad glass tinklers fluttering in the cross-breezes of its slowly twisting strands.
<p>
Most educated people today accept the idea that the brain is purely a thing of flesh and blood, neurons and axons and synapses. For most, religious faith in a noncorporeal soul is no longer the answer it may have been a century ago. The problem is to reach a modern understanding of how the glories of the mind might spring from pure matter. For anyone with a view of the mind as creative and self- aware - anyone, that is, with the vista on the soul that comes from looking inward - it is extremely unsatisfying to think of it as nothing but electrical impulses and biological tissue.
<p>
''Tissue isn't quite the right word,'' Hofstadter remarked. ''Pattern, I would say.''
<p>
Hofstadter's sense of the soul as pattern is the core of his view of how thoughts and symbols might be built up from the physical structures that neuroscientists see in their microscopes. It hardly matters whether the pattern is rooted in the firing of neurons or the marching of ants. Or the switching of silicon chips. ''The medium is different,'' as Achilles says in one of Hofstadter's recent dialogues, ''but the abstract phenomenon it supports is the same.''
<p>
Whatever the medium, Hofstadter's path to consciousness begins, not with reasoning, but with a level of stupidity and randomness. In an ant colony, to use the example Hofstadter develops at length in a key section of ''G"odel, Escher, Bach,'' we begin with ants. Consider a team of ants - a ''signal,'' Hofstadter names it - carrying a piece of food from one part of a colony to another. No ant knows where the food is going. In fact, what with all the random comings and goings of the individual ants, the whole original team may have long since scattered by the time the signal arrives at its destination. For ants, of course, we may substitute neurons - or some mechanical equivalent. In Hofstadter's Jumbo program, he substitutes ''sparks'' and ''flashes.'' 
<p>
Signals interact, too, creating patterns at still higher levels - Hofstadter calls them ''symbols'' - and eventually, out of the food-carrying,
trail-building and so forth, a genuine orderliness emerges. Of course, the ant colony doesn't exhibit anything like consciousness. Symbols in the brain represent pieces of the outside world; the ant-symbols don't. No matter how organized they get, they're still just ants, after all.
<p>
But the ant colony as a whole does have a kind of knowledge - how to grow, how to move, how to build - that is nowhere to be found in individual ants. The colony is a metaphor, meant to illustrate how a pattern of intelligence can emerge from the intertwining of different levels of activity, instead of being imposed from above. And like thoughts, the ant- symbols are sometimes orderly, sometimes erratic, always changeable and fluid.
<p>
A piece of food moves two feet across a colony. An entomologist watching it can describe that bit of behavior just that way, without any reference to the complicated underlying activity of scurrying ants. In the same way, some abilities at the top of human consciousness can be described with rules - the ability to manipulate numbers, to reason logically - and the rules are easy for computers to handle. But the rules are the end of the story, not the beginning. To focus on them exclusively is to sacrifice the potential richness of true intelligence.
<p>
''What guarantee is there,'' Hofstadter asks in his subcognition paper, ''that we can skim off the full fluidity of the top-level activity of a brain, and encapsulate it - without any lower substrate - in the form of computational rules?'' If symbols could be built up the hard way, he argues - from the interaction of many small processes, as in the Jumbo program - they would also be able to do the hard things that have so far eluded artificial intelligence.
<p>
Computers need to get bored. They need to know when they have fallen into a repetitious, machinelike rut. In solving problems that lack definite answers - in doing Jumbles, for example, without the help of an English dictionary - a machine needs to develop a sense of when it has got close enough to stop. That requires an ability that people have, the ability to watch oneself. And that, in turn, means a program must have a symbol system that includes a symbol for the program itself, that in effect makes it conscious of itself.
<p>
That isn't the kind of symbol that can easily be written into a program, the way numbers can be written in. But after all, in our own minds, numbers are not just tiny units moved from one place to another by a program following logical rules. They are huge, rich symbols floating at the top of a bubbling stew of subcognitive activity. A number like three, for example, has affinities with symbols like tricycle, numeral, tripod, four, waltz and countless others with or without names. That is one reason that a $10 calculator manipulates numbers more deftly than we do. A truly intelligent machine, with human-like symbols for numbers, might be humanly mediocre at arithmetic, because it might not have access to the computational power at the lowest level, any more than we can reach inside to the firing of our own neurons.
<p>
And as Hofstadter points out, we shouldn't be able to reach them. ''The world is not sufficiently mathematical for that to be useful in survival,'' he notes. ''What good would it do a spear thrower to be able to calculate parabolic orbits when in reality there is wind and drag and the spear is not a point mass - and so on. It's quite the contrary: a spear- thrower does best by being able to imagine a cluster of approximations of what may happen, and anticipating some plausible consequences of them.'' The loss for calculability is a gain for poetry.
<p>
This view of symbols is at the heart of the dispute in artificial
intelligence. ''The crux of the matter,'' Hofstadter argues, ''is that these people see symbols as lifeless, dead, passive objects - things to be manipulated by some overlying program. I see symbols - representational structures in the brain (or perhaps someday in a computer) - as active, like the imaginary hyperhyperteams in the ant colony. That is the level at which denotation takes place, not at the level of the single ant.'' The way symbols change and interact is not programmed in from above. It is determined not by formal rules, but by the churning of the entire system. ''We cannot decide what we will next think of,'' as Hofstadter says, ''or how our thought will progress.''
<p>
Your own symbol system now has an element you might label Douglas
Hofstadter. It may have begun as a mere bump on your computer scientist or philosopher symbol, but now it has a life of its own. It has affinities with symbols like computer, bicycle, Indiana, thought and soul. It may interact with some of these symbols in ways that refine and deepen them. Hofstadter argues that another such symbol - the most powerful and pushable of them all - is the one you might label I.
<p>
When you think about yourself, what is doing the thinking? When you think about thinking about yourself, what are you thinking about? These questions, with their implications of a hall-of-mirrors sort of infinite regress, seem to many to be a barrier to any possibility of mechanizing self-awareness. 
<p>
The British philosopher J. R. Lucas expressed this view in an often-quoted passage: ''The concept of a conscious being is, implicitly, realized to be different from that of an unconscious object. In saying that a conscious being knows something, we are saying not only that he knows it, but that he knows that he knows it, and that he knows that he knows that he knows it, and so on, as long as we care to pose the question. . . . A machine can be made in a manner of speaking to 'consider' its performance, but it cannot take this 'into account' without thereby becoming a different machine, namely the old machine with a 'new part' added. But it is inherent in our idea of a conscious mind that it can reflect upon itself and criticize its own performance, and no extra part is required to do this.''
<p>
This is a common view even among strong partisans of artificial intelligence. But the trap, perhaps, is in thinking of the self-symbol as a 'part' designed from the surface down. It may be far more fruitful to see the act of perceiving, the act of self-watching, in the pattern as a whole, not in any one layer of it. 
<p>
On Hofstadter's office wall is a somewhat tattered reproduction of one of his favorite mind-twisting Escher prints, ''The Print Gallery.'' In it, a boy stands looking at a print depicting a town where a woman looks down from her window at the roof of a gallery in which - yes - the boy stands looking at the print. We appreciate the paradox without being thrown by it, because we are outside looking in. Something like that creates our own unfathomable feelings of self. The self, subject and object, perceiver and perceived, is everywhere in the paradox.
<p>
It is a ''circling back,'' the Tortoise tells Achilles, ''of a complex representation of the system together with its representations of all the rest of the world.''
<p>
''It is just so hard, emotionally,'' Achilles tells the Tortoise, ''to acknowledge that a 'soul' emerges from so physical a system.''
<p>
Indeed, until quite recently, ''soul'' has been something of a dirty word in philosophy, and even now it suggests a reactionary throwback to mind-body dualism of a Cartesian sort. It suggests something mysterious and
unapproachable. Some prefer it that way. Like Arthur Koestler, who felt that creativity was a divine, mystical spark, they consider the human spirit beyond the scope of the natural sciences. But philosophers like Dennett believe, with Hofstadter, that scientific answers can be found without cheating by reducing the question to a manageable scale.
<p>
''They want to revel in the mystery, protect the mystery at all cost,'' Dennett said. ''Doug is not afraid to take seriously the most extravagant claims about the mind. He glorifies the phenomenon he's trying to explain. But he is a solver, and a very scrupulous one.'' Synapses and souls are hard to reconcile. But for many philosophers, and perhaps for the many nonspecialists drawn to Hofstadter's writing, the outline of a bridge from one to the other is emerging. The most valued kinds of behavior seem to depend on a willingness to recognize the soul in ourselves and others - the danger of looking only at the lowest biological level is in losing sight of the essential humanity that, in Hofstadter's view, exists in the pattern and in the paradox. ''There seems to be no alternative to accepting some sort of incomprehensible quality to
existence,'' as Hofstadter puts it. ''Take your pick.''

<b>(For a review of the what's new in the 20th Anniversary Edition, <a href="geb20">click here</a>.)</b><br /><br />Writing a book is an art. However, this normally does not refer to nonfiction books, especially scientific ones. Douglas R. Hofstadter's literary marvel is <i>the</i> exception. It is a philosophy book that reads like music, a work of art that many consider second to none.<br /><br /><i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach</i> (<i>GEB</i>) debates the question of consciousness and the possibility of artificial intelligence. It is a book that attempts to discover what self really means. Introducing the reader to cognitive science, <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach</i> draws heavily from art to illustrate fine points in mathematics. The works of M.C. Escher and J.S. Bach are discussed, in addition to other works of art and music. The topics presented range from mathematics and meta-mathematics to programming, recursion (in math as well as in computing), formal systems, multilevel systems, self reference, self representation, and others.<br /><br /><!-- table border='0' align='right' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='8' width='60%'><tr><td bgcolor='#ffcc66'>Hot off the press: Douglas R.

In writing those dialogues, Hofstadter created a whole new form of art. Concepts are presented by the dialogues on two different levels, simultaneously: <i>form</i> and <i>content</i>. The more obvious level, that of content, presents each idea directly, by providing the views of the merry band -- sometimes right, often wrong, and always funny. The true joy, however, lies in discovering the way in which Hofstadter interweaves the very same ideas into the physical <i>form</i> of the dialogue. The form deals with the same mathematical concepts discussed by the characters, and reminds the reader of the musical pieces by Bach and printed works by Escher that the characters mention directly in their talks.<br /><br />A simple example is the dialogue preceding Chapter III. Called <i>Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles</i>, this dialogue directly quotes only one character, Achilles, while he converses over the phone with his friend the Tortoise. They talk about the mathematical notion of figure and ground: how, by defining one subset of a given set, you implicitly define another subset of that same set -- the part that is <i>not</i> included in the first subset. In the visual arts, this is best exemplified by Escher's <i>Mosaic</i> lithographs, where the shapes that form the background for a group of black phantasmagorical beasts define another set of figures, in white. The musical example that Hofstadter uses is Bach's Sonatas for Unaccompanied Violin, where the listeners' imagination fill in between the notes as the violin plays, and one often imagines hearing the accompanying piano. But the form of the dialogue pulls the very same trick, as the reader can easily imagine the Tortoise answering Achilles at the other end of the line!<br /><br /><div align="center"><img src="images/1-1.jpg" height="194" width="280" border="0" /><br /><font face="Arial" color="black"><font size="-1"><i>Part of <b>Mosaic II</b> by M.C. Escher</i></font></font><br /><br /></div>Another example is the <i>Crab Canon</i>, preceding Chapter VIII. This short but highly amusing piece can be read, much like the notes of Bach's <i>Crab Canon</i>, in either direction -- from start to finish or from finish to start, resulting in the very same text. Fiendishly complex to write (or translate), the artistic beauty of that dialogue at least equals that of Bach's piece or Escher's drawing of the same name.<br /><br />But this is only the tip of the iceberg. Other issues discussed in <i>GEB</i> include, for example, self-reference and self-representation, both of which Hofstadter considers to be crucial parts of any attempt to understand what intelligence really is. Self-reference (self-ref for short) is the notion of an object, physical or conceptual, that references its own self in some manner. A person talking about himself, or even just pointing at himself, is self-referencing. Another simple instance of self-reference is the one-line paradox: <i>This Sentence is False</i>. It is easy to see that texts that reference themselves, even if they are as short as the example cited above, can lead to amusing or paradoxical results.<br /><br />Self-representation (self-rep), on the other hand, is the more complex notion of an object that includes, within itself, a complete representation of itself. This is more complicated to achieve, but one easy to grasp example would be a mirror facing another mirror. Each of these mirrors contains a complete representation of itself (in fact, it contains an infinite number of such complete self-representations, each smaller than the other).<br /><br />By playing around in an amusing manner with these, and many other, mathematical concepts, Hofstadter slowly and gently introduces the reader to more advanced mathematical ideas, like formal systems, the Church-Turing Thesis, Turing's Halting Problem and (eventually) G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem.<br /><br /><i>GEB</i> discusses some very serious matters, and it is not an easy book to tackle. However, it is very enjoyable to read, as Hofstadter augments each subject with examples from very diverse sources. The joy of discovering the puns and other playful gems hidden in the book is part of what makes it so special. Anecdotes, word plays and Zen koans are additional aspects that help make <i>GEB</i>'s 777 pages an experience that many readers consider to be a turning point in their lives.<br /><br />Like every other book published by Hofstadter, <i>GEB</i> has an index and a bibliography that must be noted as exceptionally well done.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that while <i>GEB</i> is full of English wordplay, it is in no way tied to the American origin of its author. For years, the book was considered impossible to translate, but the first translation (to French, done by Robert French and Jacqueline Henry with the help of Hofstadter himself and published in 1985) opened the gate to a flood of additional translations. So far, GEB was translated into French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian and Russian. In his latest book, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language</i> (<a href="marot">reviewed here</a>), Hofstadter discusses translations of <i>GEB</i> and the art of translation in general. It is not, however, merely a book about translation, as it might appear at first glance.<br /><br /><hr width="65%" size="1" noshade="noshade" />Some of the humor in <i>GEB</i> is really well-hidden. Check out the <a href="injokes/geb">Book In-Jokes page</a> for details about some of it, as well as many humoristic gems from other books.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0465026567">Find this book</a> using Wikipedia</div><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tr valign="top"><td width="20%"><div class="sideTitle">Also by Douglas R.

<span style="font-size: 120%;">bookshelf - GEB - Structure</span><br />
You may want to note  that in addition to references to music, more specifically to the structure of various musical forms (notably canons and fugues), the book as a whole is structured as a musical piece, a fact that may not be apparent from the onset. But if you read very attentively, by the time you reach the last page, some inexorable force compels you to turn to the first page - there to see, that which you may have missed in the beginning, but now makes the masterpiece complete  with the same feeling of resolution and satisfaction you are bound to feel at the coda of a masterful rendition of a great musical piece.<br /><br />Yes indeed, this masterpiece easily can become a turning point in ones' life.<br />This book is so unique, that when people ask me in what way is this book similar or reminiscent of some other book? I am compelled to say: It is has words, numbers and figures, printed on paper, all set in a binding  and there the similarity ends.</td></tr>

-- 1. what is &lt;alt.fan.hofstadter&gt; about?

 the one-line description supplied at the newsgroup's creation was
 "Douglas Hofstadter and Godel, Escher, Bach".

 read the newsgroup from your news server:  news:alt.fan.hofstadter

 read the newsgroup from DejaNews:
        <a href=http://www.deja.com/>http://www.deja.com/</a>=dnc/dnquery.xp?QRY=alt.fan.hofstadter

 i would guess the newsgroup has been around since the early
 1980s.  [info on the newsgroup's early history here if poss.]

 when was this RFD written?

-- 2. what is GEB?

 from the Jargon File (The Hacker's Dictionary)

|   Gdel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid
|     Douglas Hofstadter, Basic Books, 1979 [...]
|
|   This book reads like an intellectual Grand Tour of hacker
|   preoccupations. Music, mathematical logic, programming,
|   speculations on the nature of intelligence, biology, and Zen
|   are woven into a brilliant tapestry themed on the concept of
|   encoded self-reference.  [...]

 the funny character after the first "G" in the book's title is
 the German "O Umlaut".  it's an "O" with two horizontal dots on
 top.  Kurt Go:del's name is sometimes spelled as "Godel" or
 "Goedel".  nonstandard alternatives:  "Go:del", "Go"del".
 educated Americans usually pronounce Go:del as "Girdle".  the
 more authentic pronunciation of "O Umlaut" (with your mouth
 shaped for "Oh" say "Eh") would probably sound affected.

---- Does DRH read this group?

 this question has come up several times, and the short answer
 is "No".  he probably has looked at it a few times in the last
 decade.  if you post something *really* interesting, his
 students or friends will probably forward the article to him.

---- self-ref sentences, jokes

 Hofstadter talks about self-referential sentences in GEB
 and MT (Metamag. Themas).  some examples:

     This sentence contains five words.

     This sentence no verb.

     This sentence is false.

     This sentence I am now writing is the sentence you are now reading.

     This sentence sofa contains six words.

     This sentence contains two erors.

     If this sentence were in Chinese, it would say something else.

     .siht ekil ti gnidaer eb d'uoy ,werbeH ni erew ecnetnes siht fI

     I eee oai o ooa a e ooi eee o oe.
     Ths sntnc cntns n vwls nd th prcdng sntnc n cnsnnts.

     from the Unix "fortune" command:
     &gt;
     &gt; f u cn rd ths, u cn gt a gd jb n cmptr prgrmmng.
     &gt; F u cn rd ths u cnt spl wrth a dm!

 so people in &lt;alt.fan.hofstadter&gt; try to come up with new twists
 on the theme.

---- Hofstadter on Deep Blue, EMI

 Mean Chess-Playing Computer Tears at Meaning of Thought
 By BRUCE WEBER, New York Times, February 19, 1996
| ...
| "It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with
| computers becoming intelligent," said Douglas Hofstadter
| ...
| "They're just overtaking humans in certain intellectual
| activities that we thought required intelligence. My God, I used
| to think chess required thought. Now, I realize it doesn't. It
| doesn't mean Kasparov isn't a deep thinker, just that you can
| bypass deep thinking in playing chess, the way you can fly
| without flapping your wings."
| ...
|
| [in GEB , Hofstadter said ...]
| Now, he says, the computer gains of the last decade have
| persuaded him that chess is not as lofty an intellectual
| endeavor as music and writing; they require a soul.
|
| "I think chess is cerebral and intellectual," he said, "but it
| doesn't have deep emotional qualities to it, mortality,
| resignation, joy, all the things that music deals with. I'd put
| poetry and literature up there, too. If music or literature were
| created at an artistic level by a computer, I would feel this is
| a terrible thing."

 ---- Hofstadter on EMI

<a href=http://www.deja.com/>http://www.deja.com/</a>=dnc/getdoc.xp?AN=336359992

In article &lt;...&gt;, Hans Moravec  &lt;hpm@cs.cmu.edu&gt; wrote:
&gt;
&gt; Of course, shortly thereafter, Hofstadter was introduced to
&gt; David Cope's music composing program EMI.  In August 1997
&gt; New Scientist article:
&gt;
&gt; <a href=http://www.newscientist.com/ns/970809/features.html>http://www.newscientist.com/ns/970809/features.html</a>
&gt;
&gt; excerpt:
&gt;
&gt; The fact that a program running on an ordinary Macintosh
&gt; computer can produce high-quality music is turning heads in the
&gt; field of artificial intelligence, as well. "I think it's one of
&gt; the most provocative, if not the most provocative thing I've
&gt; come across in artificial intelligence," says Douglas
&gt; Hofstadter, [...]
&gt;
&gt; Hofstadter, a passionate amateur pianist, thinks most of EMI's
&gt; output still falls short of the real thing. But occasionally
&gt; it's bang on, as in the case of a "Chopin" mazurka. "When I
&gt; first played through that mazurka and got to know it, I was
&gt; quite stunned by it," he says. "It sounded to me, except for a
&gt; few glitches, as if it could slide right into the book of Chopin
&gt; mazurkas."
&gt;
&gt; Many people--including Hofstadter--find Cope's program
&gt; profoundly threatening. "EMI has no model whatsoever of life
&gt; experiences, has no sense of itself, has no sense of Chopin, has
&gt; never heard a note of music, has no trace in it of where I think
&gt; music comes from. Not a trace," he says. "I'm comparing that
&gt; with an entire human soul, one forged by the struggles and
&gt; travails of life [...]."
&gt;
&gt; Yet EMI's mazurka is all but indistinguishable from the real
&gt; thing. Does that mean, worries Hofstadter, that the composer's
&gt; soul is irrelevant to the music? "If that's the case--and I'm
&gt; not saying it is--then I've been fooled by music all my life.
&gt; I've been sucked in by a vast illusion. And that would be for me
&gt; an absolute tragedy, because my entire life I've been moved by
&gt; music," he says. "I've always felt I've been coming into contact
&gt; with the absolute essence of humanity."

 Arthur C. Clarke's "2010" (1982) Chapter 26,
 commenting on Hal's malfunction in 2001:

 "As a result, Hal developed what would be called, in human
 terms, a psychosis - specifically, schizophrenia.  Dr. C.
 informs me that, in technical terminology, Hal became trapped
 in a Hofstadter-Moebius loop, a situation apparently not
 uncommon among advanced computers with autonomous goal-seeking
 programs.  He suggests that for further information you contact
 Professor Hofstadter himself."

| "Finnegans Wake" by James Joyce.  the book begins as
| follows:
|        "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to
|        bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of
|        recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.

|
| characteristics GEB and "Finnegans Wake" share:
|       long, inspired by Carroll, contains puns and hidden
|       tricks, constant allusions in form and content, end of
|       book points to the beginning, special emphasis on
|       certain initials ("GEB", "EGB" in GEB; "HCE", "ALP" in
|       FW), etc.

        this sections contains *SPOILERS*.  skip this section if
        you want to search for the hidden GEB tricks on your own.
        these tricks are subtle enough that 99% of people who
        bought GEB have not found them.


 --- The beginning of Genesis, in ancient Hebrew

	<a href=http://www.deja.com/>http://www.deja.com/</a>=dnc/getdoc.xp?AN=383411928
                        (Simon Montagu &lt;smontagu@my-dejanews.com&gt;)
	(i thought Simon provided more detailed info, but i
	can't find it in dejanews now.)

 --- check out "chunked versions of this book" in the index.
                        (Tal Cohen &lt;tal@forum2.org&gt;)

 --- the index entry: "Dboups, Hfpsh".  shift each letter (like
        IBM-&gt;HAL) and you get "Cantor, Georg".
                        (Neil Harris &lt;neil@nharris.demon.co.uk&gt;)

 --- in the index, the entry "Hofstadter, D.R." points to Page 310.
        i wondered for a long time why this was, and discovered
        the hidden letters "HOFST" and "ADTER".

 --- in the index "Hofstadter, D.R." also points to Page 742.
        on that page, Achilles's first line ends with "host of
        formal structural tricks." (hofst); the next line begins
        with "After describing the Endless Rising" (AdtER).

        "towards the very end of the Six-Part Ricercar, ...
        Bach slyly hid his own name, split between two of the
        upper voices." (Page 719)
                        (Simon Montagu &lt;smontagu@my-dejanews.com&gt;
                        Tony Pay &lt;Tony@stsm.demon.co.uk&gt;)

 --- Page 131,
        "The confusion among the audience
            {that out-of-order popping from the stack
                (onto which the professor's verbs had been pushed,)
            is amusing to imagine,}
        could engender."

        (parentheses and indentation added)
        i hope you see the out-of-order popping from the stack.

 --- the dialogue "Aria with Diverse Variations" really ends on
        Page 404, as hinted earlier in the dialogue.  The rest
        of the dialogue follows another suggestion of including
        two extraneous characters, the coppers Silva and Gould.
        Hint about the hidden 'end': look for words with missing
        letters.                &lt;smontagu@my-dejanews.com&gt;

 --- in the Bibliography, there's "a reference ... to an
        isomorphic, but imaginary, book".   this book is
        described as "turgid and confused", the same words used
        to describe Bach's work by some critics (Page 3).
                                &lt;tal@forum2.org&gt;

 i'll add other hidden tricks you've found here, unless it's too
 obvious like TTortoise (ATTACCA) or Contracrostipunctus.

 Hofstadter described such music as "Bach squared" in GEB.

 i discovered MIDI files in summer 1998 and found it pretty
 exciting at first, but soon discovered that there are very few
 GEB-ish / experimental music MIDI files around.
 i'm maintaining this section in the hope that it may stimulate
 interest in this area.

        excerpts (.wav files) from some of the projects
        published in the July 1991 issue of IEEE COMPUTER and in
        the book "Reading in Computer Generated Music".

<a href=http://midiworld.com/collabor.htm>http://midiworld.com/collabor.htm</a>  Collaborative and Experimental MIDI

 there were several pieces i liked in this page

 --- Twilight.mid
        [...] I collaborated in writing the aleatoric ("fractal")
        software which we called AMBIENT, that produced the
        initial sequenced tracks. [...] --- Francis Joseph Leach

 --- The Sound of Mathematics
        Prime Numbers Whole Tone Quartet by Daniel Cummerow
        The music was determined prime numbers in base 5. The
        digits were mapped to 4 parts using tones of the E whole
        tone scale.

=-------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bach's 3-part and 6-part Ricercar
 [URL here]
 the arranger (sequencer?) does a good job of assigning
 distinct-sounding instruments to the voices.

 too bad he had to give it quirky, syncopated arrangement.
 when it comes to Bach, i prefer the "untouched by human hands"
 approach.

=-------------------------------------------------------------------
 the American version of the book "The Science of Musical Sound"
 by J.R.Pierce came with a thin phonogram (LP) record.
 the Jp version came with a CD containing the same material.

 among the most interesting pieces to me were:

 1. a Bach fugue played in three scales:
        a well-tempered scale, Pythagorean scale, and [one more].

        can this be done using MIDI?
        (possible to make a GM (general midi) file xxx.mid so
        that my SoundBlaster-compatible sound card can play it?)

 2. a piece (a fugue?) written in a scale which divides an
        octave into 8 equal intervals instead of the usual 12.
        can this be done using MIDI?

-- 8. submissions to this FAQ

 email submissions to &lt;tanaka@cs.indiana.edu&gt;.

 it'd be better if you could also post the submission to
 &lt;alt.fan.hofstadter&gt; and &lt;alt.tanaka-tomoyuki&gt;.

 if i become unable or unwilling to update/maintain the FAQ,
 i hope future maintainers of the FAQ will change the FAQ name
 and the archive name so that the future versions will coexist
 with, not overwrite, my version.  repositories of FAQ files are
 capable of storing multiple files for a newsgroup's directory.
 don't worry about waste of resources --- remember that today
 much of Internet traffic and computer resources are taken up by
 cyberporn.

=-------------------------------------------------------------------
motivation:

 i've always thought it strange that &lt;alt.fan.blade-runner&gt; is
 so active, with a great FAQ and all,
                        <a href=http://www.bit.net.au/~muzzle/bladerunner/>http://www.bit.net.au/~muzzle/bladerunner/</a>
			<a href=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/movies/bladerunner-faq/>http://www.faqs.org/faqs/movies/bladerunner-faq/</a>
 while &lt;alt.fan.hofstadter&gt; is so quiet.

 i wanted to write this FAQ because i thought it was a shame
 that many younger folks (even CS majors) haven't read GEB.  i
 wrote this FAQ for the same reason Oliver Stone and Camille
 Paglia can't stop talking about the 1960s.

<H1><A NAME=SECTION00010000000000000000> Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker</A></H1>
<P>
In the Dialogue, Achilles visits the Crab and admires his recently 
acquired Magritte paintings---or are they really paintings?  
The Crab takes out and smokes the pipe in <i>The Shadows</i> (and later 
puts it away in <i>The Air and the Song</i>) and offers 
the cigar in <i>State of Grace</i> to Achilles, who however declines, 
slightly dizzied by this unnatural behaviour of the paintings...
<P>
The Crab recites a poem by J. S. Bach about the pious thoughts awakened 
in his mind when watching the curls of smoke rising from his 
pipe.<A NAME=tex2html1 HREF="#9"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
In my opinion, the <em>really</em> edifying thoughts of a tobacco smoker should 
arise from contemplation of chest X-rays...
<P>
The Crab turns out to write poems of his own and plays a recording of a 
pseudo-limerick for Achilles.<A NAME=tex2html2 HREF="#142"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
<P>
The record player the Crab uses is his latest invention in his battle
against the Tortoise. In <i>Contracrostipunctus</i> the Tortoise mentioned
that the Crab had commissioned a self-reassembling Record Player Omega but
due to the Tortoise's sudden sleepiness we were not told how it had fared.
Now it is revealed that the tortuous Tortoise indeed had demolished that one as
well, since the reassembly controller had to stay constant and thus was
subject to the fatal vibrations. But the Crab, while reading Gebstadter's
book on metal-logic, <i>Copper, Silver, Gold: an Indestructible Metallic
Alloy</i>, ran upon a description of viruses and noted that they have the
ability to ``spontaneously self-assemble from their component units'' and
thus do not need any reassembly controller.
<P>
A spontaneously self-assembling phonograph is constructed, but the Tortoise
yet again reduces it to smithereens. Now, this is rather curious, since for
a ``spontaneously self-assembling'' entity it should not matter if it is
reduced to its component units, as these should just crawl together and
rebuild the original unit (those who have seen the movie <i>Hardware</i>
know what it would look like). Hofstadter is really straining the analogy
here (for, in spite of his use of the term ``isomorphism'', he is really
making <em> analogies</em>), but of course ``component units'' are not really
atomic as we have noted for example with real atoms (we are making an
analogy here) which are not atomic either, but can be decomposed into
smaller subunits that lose the identity of their previous aggregate. Thus,
if the Tortoise manages to destroy the component units of the
self-assembling phonograph, there no longer will be anything that can
self-assemble.
<P>
Now, the Crab was almost as devastated as his phonograph and finally gave 
up on trying to get a record player that could play any and all sounds 
and instead tries to get a record player that will only play records it 
knows will not damage it, and this cautious phonograph is what now is 
standing before Achilles and the Crab.  The Tortoise, in his ambition to 
always be one up on the rest of the gang (doesn't he remind you a lot of 
Skalman?), now instead tries to make records that will slip by the Crab's 
defences.
<P>
We note that Hofstadter leaves the analogy of record players as 
formal systems and instead introduces the analogy of record players as 
living organisms or even living cells, where the screening for malign 
records matches the immune system's screening for pathogenic 
microorganisms---viri in particular as these can subvert the reproduction 
apparatus of the cell.
<P>
The intellectually fleet-footed Achilles is fascinated by the television
camera in the record player and the Crab takes it out and lets him play
with it. He goes on to discover the interesting things you can do with a
video camera if you point it at its own output---self-engulfing. (Do by all
means try this at home kids, it's quite amusing.) The ``galaxy'' in
figure 81.j has 13 spokes, which probably is interesting as it is a prime
and does not correspond to any of the ``magic'' angles <MATH>&pi;/3</MATH>, <MATH>&pi;/4</MATH>,
<MATH>&pi;/6</MATH>, ... (and it is one more than the number of pictures on the 
spread).
<P>
After a while Achilles gets the idea that a <em> complete</em> self-engulfing 
requires that he capture the camera as well in his picture, but that 
requires a mirror and then that is included in the system and will have 
to be included in the pictures as well, which would require yet another 
mirror, etc ad infinitum.  This reminds us of Chapter XV, ``Jumping out 
of the System'' and furthers the point that you really <em> cannot</em> jump 
out of the system, that study of the system has to be done from within 
the system.
<P>
After thinking about this for a while Achilles needs a wee lie down and 
the dialogue ends with his imminent reverse peristalsis.  (I would feel 
sick too, after all that pipe smoke.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00011000000000000000> Cross-references</A></H2>
<P>
The copper, silver, gold triad turns up in the copper lining of the Crab's
pipe (p. 481), the silver lining to his problems (p. 486) and the gold
lining on his paintings (p. 494).
<P>
As always the characters in the dialogues in <i>Copper, Silver, Gold</i> are
``exceedingly droll'' (p. 485).
<P>
In <i>Contracrostipunctus</i> the Tortoise tries to slip in a 
record<A NAME=tex2html3 HREF="#143"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> ``I Cannot Be Played 
on Record Player X'' in the Crab's phonograph and Achilles doubts he will 
manage that.  The following dialogue ensues (p. 78):
<DL ><DT><i>Tortoise:</i>
<DD> Curious that you should think so... I don't suppose 
that you know Gdel's Incompleteness Theorem backwards and forwards, do 
you?
<DT><i>Achilles:</i>
<DD> Know <em> whose</em> Theorem backwards and forwards?  I've 
never heard of anything that sounds like that.  I'm sure it's fascinating, 
but I'd rather hear more about ``music to break records by''.  It's an 
amusing little story.  Actually, I guess I can fill in the end.  
Obviously, there was no point in going on, and so you sheepishly 
admitted defeat, and that was that.  Isn't that exactly it?
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Now that the Tortoise instead tries to slip in a  record 
``I Can Be Played on Record Player X'' a complementary repartee takes 
place (p. 488):
<DL ><DT><i>Crab:</i>
<DD> Curious that you should think so... I don't suppose 
that you know Henkin's Theorem forwards and backwards, do 
you?
<DT><i>Achilles:</i>
<DD> Know <em> whose</em> Theorem forwards and backwards?  I've 
never heard of anything that sounds like that.  I'm sure it's fascinating, 
but I'd rather hear more about ``music to infiltrate phonographs by''.  It's an 
amusing little story.  Actually, I guess I can fill in the end.  
Obviously, Mr. T will find out that there is no point in going on, 
and so he will sheepishly 
admit defeat, and that will be that.  Isn't that exactly it?
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Actually, it is quite curious that the Crab should believe himself to be 
able to outwit the Tortoise if he actually <em> does</em> know Henkin's theorem 
forwards and backwards, but since the Tortoise isn't there (in the 
Dialogue) to deliver the 
line, the Crab has to do it.  (Henkin sentences are explained on 
p. 541<i>ff</i>.)
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00020000000000000000> Self-Ref and Self-Rep</A></H1>
<P>
Hofstadter starts out the chapter by claiming that achieving
self-reference by such means as ``This sentence...'' requires a great
deal of understanding of English, whereas quining is a more explicit and
more readily understood construction.
<P>
He then goes on to discuss how to construct a self-reproducing program.  
This is very dependent on how the language used is constructed, a 
programming language that explicitly supports self-reproduction would of 
course allow for very simple self-reproducing programs, but this, just as 
``This sentence...'' offloads too much of the problem on the processing 
unit and hides the interesting parts of the self-reproduction mechanism.
<P>
Therefore, a properly self-reproducing entity should actually contain the 
instructions for its own self-reproduction, ``to the maximum extent 
possible'', which may or may not be well-defined.
<P>
The question is then, what is to be considered a copy of an original?  
Some variations are suggested, such as a program copying itself backwards 
or translating itself into another language (the former may of course be 
considered to be a special case of the latter).  The latter in particular 
has relevance when we are talking about Gdel-numbering, as  in the 
string <b>G</b>, which uses its own Gdel-translation into a number to talk 
about itself.
<P>
Self-reproduction by living organisms is yet another variant of non-literal
copying, in that the offspring is not a perfect copy of its parent(s).
Hofstadter uses the term ``coarse-grained isomorphism'' to describe the
relation between offspring and ancestors, that the <em> family resemblance</em>
is the invariant. This I think glosses over several non-trivial points
about the Biological Species Concept and the evolution of the genome, as
object-oriented inheritance really is not the same as genetic inheritance,
but we'll let it stand for the nonce.
<P>
Another question is, if we make a copy of an original, what was the 
original, was it merely the text that got copied, or the text and the 
environment that copied it?
<P>
Now is introduced <em>Typogenetics</em>, a simple model of molecular 
genetics on the level of DNA replication, ignoring questions about 
low-level chemistry and the high-level bio<em> logical</em> phenomena.
<P>
The typogenetical alphabet consists of only four characters, A, C, G and T.
They are called <em>bases</em> and their positions, in the strings they build up,
<em>units</em>. These strings, or <em>strands</em>, can be operated on by <em>enzymes</em> which are packets of basic operations known as <em>amino
acids</em>. Every enzyme will always start on a given character, so there will be
four groups of enzymes. Furthermore, A and G are called <em>purines</em> and C and
T <em>pyrimidines</em>. Purines and pyrimidines are complementary so that copy
operations will copy As as Ts and Gs as Cs and vice versa.
<P>
The enzymes are actually created by <em>ribosomes</em> first crawling along the
strand and creating the enzymes that are then let loose to operate on the
strand.  Unfortunately the description of Typogenetics is somewhat ambiguous,
but some reasonable assumptions can be made: searching amino acids (lpu, rpu,
lpy, rpy) will run off
the end of the strand if they do not find the base they are looking for; only
one enzyme at a time will be active, but that all enzymes will have a go, in no
determined order, but only once, after which they will disappear; a
one-amino-acid enzyme will attach to an A.
<P>
The strand is divided into pairs of bases, duplets, and each pair will
define an amino acid. The sequence of amino acids is known as the <em>primary structure</em> of an enzyme. It also has a <em>tertiary</em> structure
which is its configuration in 2D space---each amino acid will define for the
position of the next amino acid in the sequence whether it will be aligned
with the current amino acid or to the left or to the right of it. (We may
wonder where the <em>secondary</em> structure ended up---for real enzymes it
is of some importance, but it has been ignored in Typogenetics due to the
simplified model, where the secondary structure does not fit in well---but
we will hear of the secondary structure later in the chapter.) It now turns
out that the tertiary structure, or rather, the orientation of the last two
relative to the first two amino acids determines the binding preferences of
the enzyme, i e whether it will start operating on an A, C, G or
T.
<P>
The AA pair does not code for any particular operation, but instead is a 
separator between different <em>genes</em> in a  strand, so that many 
different enzymes can be coded for by a single strand.
<P>
Hofstadter then suggests that we attempt to define a self-replicating
typogenetic strand.  It took me a while, but it is actually possible.  The
self-replicating strand I found is CG TT TT TT TG.  Here is how the replication proceeds:
<OL><LI> CG TT TT TT TG (let's call it <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>) is transcribed into the enzyme
cop--lpu--lpu--lpu--lpy (call it <MATH>e<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>).  This
enzyme folds left + left + left, with the result that the last segment is
folded to the right relative to the first and therefore this enzyme will bind
to a G.
<LI> There are two alternative attachment points for the enzyme, the second
base or the tenth base (call them <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>0</SUB></BOX><SUB>1</SUB></MATH> and <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>0</SUB></BOX><SUB>9</SUB></MATH>, respectively).  If
it attaches to <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>0</SUB></BOX><SUB>1</SUB></MATH>, the following happens:
<OL><LI> The enzyme turns on copying and attaches a C opposite the G.  Next the
enzyme moves left looking for a purine while still copying.  As no further
purines are present to the left of the G, the enzyme ceases operations and the
second strand, consisting of CG, (call this <MATH>S<SUB>1</SUB></MATH>) is released.
<P>
<LI> <MATH>S<SUB>1</SUB></MATH> is  transcribed, which results in an  enzyme cop (<MATH>e<SUB>1</SUB></MATH>).  <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH> is
also transcribed, resulting in a new <MATH>e<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>.
<LI> <MATH>e<SUB>1</SUB></MATH> would attach to an A, but since there is none, it is thrown away
and has no effect on anything.  The <MATH>e<SUB>0</SUB></MATH> may either attach to <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>0</SUB></BOX><SUB>1</SUB></MATH> as
before, in which case it will generate further copies of <MATH>S<SUB>1</SUB></MATH>, or it may
attach to <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>1</SUB></BOX><SUB>1</SUB></MATH>, which happens to have the same result.  It may also attach
to  <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>0</SUB></BOX><SUB>9</SUB></MATH>, which has different results.
</OL>
If <MATH>e<SUB>0</SUB></MATH> attaches to <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>0</SUB></BOX><SUB>9</SUB></MATH>, the following happens:
<OL><LI> The enzyme turns on copying and attaches a C opposite the G.  Next the
enzyme moves left looking for a purine while still copying and will find
<MATH><BOX>S<SUB>0</SUB></BOX><SUB>1</SUB></MATH>.  Then the enzyme will move further left looking for a new purine,
and as there is none, the enzyme will fall off the end of the strand and cease
operations, after having made the complement of <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>.  This complement is CA
AA AA AA CG (<MATH>S<SUB>2</SUB></MATH>).
<LI> <MATH>S<SUB>2</SUB></MATH> is transcribed and results in two enzymes, mvr (<MATH>e<SUB>2<SUB>0</SUB></SUB></MATH>) and cop
(<MATH>e<SUB>2<SUB>1</SUB></SUB></MATH>).  Both will attach to As. <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>  (and any <MATH>S<SUB>1</SUB></MATH>s) will also be
transcribed.
<LI> <MATH>e<SUB>2<SUB>0</SUB></SUB></MATH> can attach to any of the As in <MATH>S<SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, where it will move one
base to the right and then cease operations.  This changes nothing.
<LI> <MATH>e<SUB>1</SUB></MATH> and <MATH>e<SUB>2<SUB>1</SUB></SUB></MATH>, which are identical, may also attach to any of the
As in <MATH>S<SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, where they will cause a T to be attached opposite to that A and
then cease operations.  The T will be set loose, and as it cannot be
transcribed, nothing will come from it.
<LI>  <MATH>e<SUB>0</SUB></MATH> may either attach to <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>, as before, in which case we know what
will happen, or it may attach to <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>2</SUB></BOX><SUB>9</SUB></MATH>.  In this case it turns on copying,
attaching a C opposite the G.  It then moves left looking for a purine while
copying and finds <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>2</SUB></BOX><SUB>7</SUB></MATH>.  It then moves further left looking for a purine
and finds <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>2</SUB></BOX><SUB>6</SUB></MATH>.  It then moves further left looking for a pyrimidine,
finds <MATH><BOX>S<SUB>2</SUB></BOX><SUB>0</SUB></MATH> and ceases operations.  It now has created the complement of
<MATH>S<SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, which is CG TT TT TT TG.  As this is the same as <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>, and <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>
still is intact, we now have two copies of <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>, which thus has replicated.
The cycle may start over again.
</OL></OL>
<P>
An interesting question now is whether this in fact is the shortest possible
self-reproducing string.  Definitely it gives us a very low upper bound on the
shortest replicator and it seems not entirely infeasible to (write a program
to) try all <MATH>4<SUP>10</SUP> = 1048576</MATH> strands shorter or equal to ten bases to see if
they can replicate.  Furthermore, we might be interested in finding a strand
which will only need one transcription cycle in order to replicate, rather than
the two of <MATH>S<SUB>0</SUB></MATH>, but for this we do not have any upper bounds (yet).  We might
also wonder whether it actually is necessary to create an exact copy of the
original strand in order to have self-replication: several different strands
may be ``functionally'' equivalent in some sense and we may not bother which of
the strands in this equivalence class we actually have at the end of the
replication---we could indeed say that if we have strands that can generate new
strands that in turn can create new strands, we have replication, regardless of
the actual likeness of the daughter strands to the parent strand.  We must of
course insist that the <MATH><TEXT>daughter</TEXT><SUP>n</SUP></MATH> strands always can create new
strands themselves---it doesn't count if only the parent strand churns out new
strands.
<P>
There have been attempts to use these kinds of molecules to do actual
computations [<A HREF="geb.html#Adleman94">Adleman, 1994</A>], and while these definitely are interesting it is
not obvious that there is a practical way to have molecular computers.  In
particular exponential problems still grow exponentially, parallelism just
delays the point where one has to give up [<A HREF="geb.html#Hartmanis95">Hartmanis, 1995</A>].
<P>
Then is defined the <em> Central Dogma of Typogenetics</em>, which shows that
neither strands nor enzymes can be considered to be only data or programs,
but that they change places in a Strange Loop. (Hands drawing each other...) This is in
contrast to the MIU-system, TNT and other formal systems, where the wffs
cannot modify the inference rules in any way. <em> But</em>, claims Hofstadter,
TNT still can talk about itself, through Gdel numbering.
<P>
We now go on to look at <em> real</em> DNA and how it behaves.  The 
typogenetic A, C, G and T are matched by adenine, cytosine, guanine and 
thymine.  The pyrimidine/purine distinction is one of their chemical 
structure and the reason the two types are complementary is that  
DNA is a double strand in which the bases form the connections between 
the two halves; a purine and its corresponding a pyrimidine is  the same width as 
the other purine and <em> its</em> pyrimidine. The parts of DNA that are not 
bases are a standard unit of deoxy phosphate groups and ribose sugars. 
Together with one base, this unit is known as a <em> nucleotide</em>.  
Nucleotides bind strongly to each other, the bases do not bind quite as 
strongly to each other, therefore the DNA can be ``unzipped''.  This is 
necessary both for transcription (decoding) and for replication, when two 
new DNA strands are created, using the original as template.
<P>
Figure 93 shows the standard image of a coiled DNA ``double helix''.  One 
should point out that DNA actually coils in several ways simultaneously, much as a 
piece of string that is  continuously twined in one direction.  In the 
end, the DNA is coiled so thickly that it can be seen in a microscope as a
``chromosome''.  DNA is usually coiled completely only during cell 
division, when it has to be carefully ordered so nothing will break off 
when the chromosomes are divided among the daughter cells (this of course 
occasionally happens anyway, with sometimes dire consequences), but for 
transcription, the relevant part has to be uncoiled [<A HREF="geb.html#Grunstein92">Grunstein, 1992</A>].
<P>
Hofstadter goes on to explain how the DNA is situated in the walled-off nucleus of 
the cell and messages have to be transferred to the organelles outside 
the nucleus that actually create the proteins coded for by the DNA.  
(This is really neglecting the majority of the Earth's 
inhabitants, the prokaryotes---bacteria, archaebacteria, cyanobacteria, 
et al---that do not have nucleated cells.)
<P>
<em> Enzymes</em> are  special proteins that catalyse the many reactions
that a living organism depends on and normally don't occur at the measly
temperature of 310 K, over which, on the other hand, most organic
compounds are denatured and/or degraded (broken apart without hope of
spontaneous self-assembly).
<P>
Now enter <em> RNA</em>.  RNA reminds a lot of DNA, but is single stranded and
replaces thymine with uracil, another pyrimidine.  (There are reasons to
suspect that DNA has evolved from RNA, in particular since RNA can operate on
itself---one end of the very flexible single strand can cut and splice at
the other end.)
<P>
Transcription is a fairly complex process that involves many cooperating
and counterbalanced functions, but the end result is that an enzyme known
as RNA polymerase starts to move along a <em> gene</em>, unzipping the DNA and
making an RNA copy of one half of it (it is deterministic which half, as 
the DNA strand has a direction).  Indeed, several RNA polymerase enzymes 
may be transcribing the same gene, one hot on the heels of another.  The
RNA copy is called <em> messenger RNA</em>, or mRNA for short. When the gene
runs to an end the mRNA is taken out of the nucleus and brought to a
ribosome (which among other things contains <em> ribosomal RNA</em>, rRNA).
Actually, since we are talking eukaryotes, all introns (non-coding,
``junk'' parts) are first edited out of the mRNA. The ribosome moves along
the mRNA by groups of three bases (the original triplet in the DNA is
called a <em> codon</em>, we will call the mRNA triplet a codon as well). For
each codon there is a particular <em> transfer RNA</em>, tRNA, that will match
that and only that (well, chemistry <em> is</em> a random process, but
this is a very, very skewed distribution) codon. This tRNA will bring with
it an amino acid which is specific for it. (There are <MATH>4<SUP>3</SUP> = 64</MATH> different
ways to combine the four bases to make codons, but they only code for
twenty amino acids---the last base in a codon is usually redundant.) This
amino acid will be picked up by the ribosome, the tRNA is released and goes
out to look for a new amino acid, the ribosome moves along to the next
codon and a new tRNA with an amino acid comes along, this amino acid is
joined to the previous one and the process is then repeated until the mRNA
strand is exhausted. Often several ribosomes may be active on the same
mRNA, in pipeline fashion. All this sounds so purposeful, some become
religious on account of it, but we shall consider that to be chickening 
out.
<P>
The amino acid chain built up in this way is then released from the ribosome
and starts folding in on itself to form a protein. The primary structure is, as
we recall, the order of the amino acids. The secondary structure is the buildup
of a number of basic motifs, the alpha helix, beta sheet, random coil and 
others, these are then folded further together to
form the tertiary structure.  The quaternary structure is the connections of
multiple peptide chains building up a protein.
<P>
How this folding takes place is a matter of much concern for molecular
biologists. While much still is computationally intractable, advances have
been made since <i>GEB:EGB</i> was written [<A HREF="geb.html#Kinoshita90">Kinoshita, 1990</A>]. Primary mechanisms are the affinity of the amino
acids for water, so that water-hating amino acids will end up on the inside
of the protein and water-loving on the outside, but there are of course
other parameters, such as hydrogen and sulphur bonds. Also, this final
structure need not be uniquely determined, which has consequences, as we
shall see later.
<P>
A folded protein now has various properties on account of its folded, 
three-dimensional structure, such as elasticity or rigidity for 
structural proteins or grooves suitable for catching other molecules to 
modify for 
catalytic proteins, enzymes.  Hofstadter cautions us not to fall for the 
holistic heresy just because the function of a protein cannot be 
determined as a context-free function of each individual amino acid, as 
in Typogenetics.
<P>
While we are not as yet able to tell, by just determining the codon 
sequence in a gene, whether a person will have the potential (remember 
the difference between genotype and phenotype) to become e g a 
talented musician, there is much work that finds correlations between 
genes and their expressions.  So we could imagine a future in which we 
can, by studying the genome of an individual, tell what she probably 
looks like or whether she could be a good musician, still without knowing 
<em> how</em> the genes give rise to these traits.
<P>
While tRNA, ribosomes and the rest are certainly the results of
transcription from DNA, it cannot bootstrap itself entirely on its own, the
transcription apparatus must already be there from the start. Those who
didn't become religious earlier, usually do so now, but we will persist in
seeing this as an ongoing, continually modified tradition from the first,
very much simpler self-replicating systems that somehow arose 
spontaneously.  (The twenty amino acids used by Earth organisms
are also the simplest amino acids, and a number of them have been 
observed in space, so they at least can arise spontaneously, and as the 
Miller-Urey experiments in the 50s showed, can polymerise under fairly 
simple conditions.)
<P>
We note in passing also notes that transcription does not have to be
unique, the previously mentioned virus <MATH>&phi;X174</MATH> manages to code for two
different proteins in the same piece of DNA by shifting the reading frame
one unit.<A NAME=tex2html4 HREF="#144"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> Hofstadter

<P>
DNA of course has to have the ability to replicate itself, which it can 
do with the help of  enzymes that  unzip the double strand and add 
complementary nucleotides to the resulting single strands to build new 
double strands.  Separation into single strands can even be done by 
gentle heating [<A HREF="geb.html#Mullis90">Mullis, 1990</A>].
<P>
Hofstadter then makes an elaborate analogy between Molecular Biology and 
Mathematical Logic in which it turns out that the Genetic Code was the 
model for the Gdel Code used in Chapter IX.
<P>
Then we get a mapping between the <i>Contracrostipunctus</i> and Molecular
Biology, in which it is claimed that one always can create a strand of DNA,
which, when injected into a suitable cell, will cause the destruction of
this cell. DNA of this kind is in nature supplied by viri. (Though
Hofstadter, to make the analogy with the Tortoise's malignant records more
complete, makes the additional proviso that the injected DNA be rendered
inoperative by the destruction of the cell, something that real viri of
course would not benefit from.)
<P>
Viri operate by injecting genetic material into a host cell. This host cell
will then express this foreign DNA, creating new viri in such huge
quantities that the cell finally bursts and spews out the viri, which can
then go forth and infect new cells. I choose the term ``genetic material''
rather than ``DNA'' for indeed not all viri do carry and inject DNA. <em>
Retroviri</em> instead carry RNA (which presumably, while being more sensitive
to breaks and errors in transcription, takes less space), which is then
converted into DNA by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This
contradicts the .DOGMA I that says that information flows from DNA to RNA
to proteins, and caused some amount of upset at the time.<A NAME=tex2html6 HREF="#146"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> We note that bacteria can label their DNA and thus recognise
foreign DNA, at least until the viri also learn to label their DNA the same
way.
<P>
As we said, while being a counterpart of Gdel strings, self-destroying 
viri are not viable, but real viri <em> do</em> replicate themselves in host 
cells, and indeed there is a mathematical counterpart to these as well.  
These are the <em> Henkin sentences</em>, which are in essence the negation 
of Gdel sentences, in that they assert that they <em> can</em> be proven in TNT.  
Henkin sentences may just assert that there <em> is</em> a derivation of them 
in TNT, in which case they are called <em> implicit</em>, or they may contain 
their own derivation, in which case they are <em> explicit</em> 
sentences.  Explicit 
sentences obviously need not be theorems.
<P>
This has a counterpart in the realm of viri: self-assembling viri only 
code for their component parts and these will then find each other and 
make up new viri.  In these they can be likened to implicit Henkin 
sentences.  Other viri need to code for the enzymes that will direct 
their assembly, these are then like explicit Henkin sequences.
<P>
The discussion about repressors and inducers can be profitably enhanced 
by reading [<A HREF="geb.html#Tjian95">Tjian, 1995</A>].  We just note that 
transcription of a gene starts from something called a <em> TATA</em> box.

In the Dialogue, the Tortoise and the Crab seem to be out to pull Achilles
leg out of its socket. The Crab tells about a letter he had gotten from an
Indian mathematician by the name of Najunamar (Ramanujan backwards for the
truly dense) who has proved many very peculiar (and trivial) mathematical problems. The Crab takes this as proof of the mystical insight
given to Orientals, but the Tortoise is more skeptical.
<P>
The Crab takes out his flute and plays.  To Achilles his 
note sheets look like TNT statements, and indeed, the Crab's appreciation 
of music seems to be directly coupled to whether the TNT statements are 
theorems or not.  In particular he likes the melody that corresponds to 
the statement ``13 is prime'' (p. 553).  When Achilles modifies it to 
``14 is prime'' (p. 554), the Crab is very displeased and neither does he like the 
tune ``17 is not prime'' (ibid.).  ``<MATH>3<SUP>2</SUP> + 4<SUP>2</SUP> = 5<SUP>2</SUP></MATH>'' (p. 553) is 
acceptable, as is ``<MATH>b<SUP>2</SUP> = 2a<SUP>2</SUP></MATH> only if <MATH>a</MATH> is 0''.  
The long tune ``50 is the smallest number that can be written as a sum of 
two squares in two different ways'' (p. 557) is also acceptable.  Achilles, 
having tested the Crab's ability in these ways, then attempts to prove 
the Goldbach Conjecture (p. 557), but the Crab excuses himself and will 
not take up the offer.
<P>
It seems as if Achilles catches on to the other two putting him on as he
notes that ``this'' (which could be interpreted as the hill they are on) is
a bluff and that he will have to remember that. He also says something
about a ``prime teas[e]''.  Still he expresses his admiration for the Crab, so the brave man
apparently holds no grudge against him.<A NAME=tex2html7 HREF="#116"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>

There are a number of references made to Srinivasa

(p. 551) is the well-known Ramanujan number that is the smallest number that
can be written as a sum of two cubes in two different ways, and which happened
to be number of the cab G. H. Hardy had taken to Ramanujan's home one
day. Finding the smallest number expressible as the sum of two squares in two
different ways (p. 557) is of course simpler. On Hardy's question about the
corresponding number for fourth powers, Ramanujan conjectured that it would be
``very large'' (p. 564). Also, the Crab's reason for disbelieving Najunamar is
the opposite of Hardy's reason to believe Ramanujan (p. 563). However, I do not
think Ramanujan had anything to do with any attempts to prove the Four-Colour
Theorem. (Note that the index refers to p. <em> 550</em> for ``Four-color Theorem,
parodied'', rather than p. 551, where it occurs in my book. (P. 550 is taken up
by an Escher picture.) The ``Goldbach Conjecture, parodied'' and ``Fermat's

The Crab's statement that ``... two tildes in a row never fails to give a gay

Chapter XVII (or rather, Douglas Hofstadter) is concerned with showing how brains and computer programs 
are ``isomorphic'' to each other on a sufficiently high level.  As a 
stepping stone for this we are introduced to the Church-Turing Thesis.  
This thesis (which is <em> not</em> a proven Theorem, but a conjecture 
on the part of Church, Turing and others) says that for any kind of 
mathematical problem that humans know how to solve there will be a 
recursive function that can do the same.
<P>
Srinivasa Ramanujan and ``idiots savants'', that seemingly can perform
mathematical miracles without rec[o]ursing to the plodding algorithms most of
us use, are set up as straw men. Hofstadter blithely assumes that these math
wizards in fact use the same algorithms as the rest of us (or possibly
optimised variants of them) but  execute them very, very fast. The
arguments for this are that Ramanujan often was wrong in his theories and
that ``lightning calculators'' indeed perform slower the larger the numbers
they have to manipulate get. We will accept the conclusion for the time
being.
<P>
A bolder version of the CT Thesis then says that not only can humans and
machines utilise algorithms that give the same results, but that these
algorithms in fact are the <em> same</em>---not meaning that humans necessarily
employ the same standard algorithms as computers,
but that the algorithms used by humans can be translated into isomorphic
recursive functions.
<P>
Now, most of us can accept that this may be true for doing mathematics, 
but what about daily life?  As noted in the beginning of the chapter, an 
intelligent being not only has to be able to make deductions about the 
state of the world, but also have a feeling for what deductions are 
sensible/useful to make in this infinitely complex universe we live in.
<P>
In mathematics one can take a very high-level view of what is going on, 
but in real life (as in molecular genetics), the levels are tangled 
together, in particular the creative human qualities of reasoning by analogy
and imagery.  So, if we are to make a recursive function that simulates a 
brain we cannot just take the highest-level processes and simulate them, 
as they are interdependent on lower level processes but have to simulate 
lower levels as well, possibly all the way down to the ``hardware'' 
(neurons).  This sounds a lot like what  connectionists are doing today, 
and indeed Hofstadter follows up by noting that having a neural network 
does not necessarily imply that higher-level meaning automatically appears.
<P>
Also, if we are to simulate neurons, we have to ascertain that everything 
that goes on in them is indeed computable by a recursive function, which 
is stated by yet another reformulation of the CT Thesis.  While 
this may seem obvious, there are indeed thinkers, such as Roger Penrose, that claim that minds 
depend on magical 
quantum mechanical phenomena that cannot be reproduced by computation 
[<A HREF="geb.html#Penrose89">Penrose, 1989</A>].  Still, 
Hofstadter hopes that AI will not require simulation of neural networks.  
I haven't read his latest book, so I do not know if he still holds on to 
this in spite of the spectacular success of artificial neural networks, 
subsumption architectures and other ``low-level'' approaches to 
intelligent systems [<A HREF="geb.html#Minsky94">Minsky, 1994</A>,<A HREF="geb.html#Wallich91">Wallich, 1991</A>].
<P>
Then we go on to questions of Truth and Beauty. ``Soulists'' believe that
humans, or any living organisms for that matter, have some
characteristic(s) that set them apart from non-living matter. (When we look
at prions, viri and synthetic self-replicating molecules [<A HREF="geb.html#Rebek94">Rebek, Jr., 1994</A>] the
question of what exactly separates living from non-living matter rears its
ugly head. We will stick ours in the sand.) Nowadays I think the polite
term is not ``soul'', but ``consciousness'' [<A HREF="geb.html#Horgan94">Horgan, 1994</A>,<A HREF="geb.html#Searle90">Searle, 1990</A>], but
it seems to boil down to much the same concept. If minds indeed <em> are</em>
different from machines then it is of course possible that they could
perform such feats of Truth-recognition as the Crab purported to do in the
Dialogue, even though they are forbidden for machines by Church's Theorem.
Furthermore, concepts such as Beauty may then be unique for minds and
inaccessible to mere computers.  This does not necessarily mean that 
there will be a single, concept of Beauty that all minds or souls will 
agree on, since minds presumably can have their own ideas about what they 
do and do not like.
<P>
The Theodore Roszak who is mentioned in the text is a professor of history at
Cal State Hayward. He is best known for his 1969 book <i>The Making of a
Counter Culture</i>. In it, he criticized the ``objective'' way of viewing the
world, and the scientific way of explanation that involves a sharp separation
between objective and subjective knowledge. He seems to have objected not to
science itself, but with the 20th century view that seeing the world through
science is the only way of looking at it.<A NAME=tex2html9 HREF="#132"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>

So, if rational behaviour can be programmed on computers, what about the 
thoroughly irrational behaviour humans often engage in?  There is of 
course a fundamental question of whether people ever engage in irrational 
behaviour at all, it seems to be much a matter of definition, but in 
anyway, there is absolutely nothing that keeps perfectly rational and 
reliable processes from giving irrational results.  We know these 
phenomena as <em> bugs</em>.
<P>
Hofstadter takes yet a few swings at J. R. Lucas for having confused 
levels of AI programs and says that the hardware level is the only one 
that by necessity will be a formal logical system, whereas the higher 
levels, those which represent actual thoughts and beliefs, do not have to 
implement e g propositional logic.
<P>
Church's Theorem says that there is no recursive function that can determine
whether a given string of TNT is a theorem in TNT.  Tarski's Theorem says that
there is non-recursive function that can determine the <em> truth</em> of a given
TNT string either.  Assuming that the CT Thesis is true, it then follows that
humans cannot do these either, and that presumably goes for Crabs as well.  The
question is then, as someone pointed out, that if we were to find a Truth by
other means than a recursive function, how would we demonstrate the validity of
our claim to anyone else?  It seems that the only means we (as scientists in
the Westernised world, at least) agree upon as conveying Truth try to be as
close to recursive functions as possible, as we consider these explanations to
be simple enough to trust.
<P>
But then, assuming we have determined a truth, or a falsity, we cannot 
consciously believe that that and its negation are valid at the same 
time.  Hofstadter suggests that perhaps conflicting truth values, such as 
in the Epimenides sentence, attempt to set up patterns in the brain that 
<em> physically</em> cannot be active at the same time.

proof that human thoughts map imperfectly onto formal logic, though 
it probably more indicates the necessity for accounting for temporal

course that one is allowed to pray should one's mind turn to  
Matters Unworldly while smoking, like it did for Bach, but one should not be so

At least in appearance, Douglas R. Hofstadter's latest book is reminiscent of his first, <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach</i> (<i>GEB</i>, <a href="/geb">reviewed here</a>): chapters interwoven with brief sections of artistic playfulness. Each chapter elaborates on the themes presented in the interlude preceding it. In <i>GEB</i>, the interludes were dialogs between imaginary characters; in <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i>, they are dozens of variations and translations (written by Hofstdter, friends, and family members) of a single ancient French poem. The poem is called <i>A une Damoyselle malade</i> (To a Sick Damsel), originally written by Clement Marot.<br /><br />At first glance, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> is a book about the art of translation, written by a computer scientist. However, this is a mistaken view. The book is, like most of Hofstadter's previous works, a discussion of the nature of consciousness, the meaning of self, and the possibility of artificial intelligence, which is the author's subject of research. It is simply that this book takes on the subject from a different angle, focusing initially on linguistic issues.<br /><br />Hofstadter was apparently drawn into the world of translation when the first attempts were made to translate <i>GEB</i> to French, German, and other languages. Being fluent in several languages (he describes himself as Pilingual, fluent in Pi languages), the author took an active part in the various translation efforts. In <i>GEB</i>, the relation between languages, translation and the nature of the human mind was discussed in the dialogue <i>English, French, German Suite</i> and the following chapter (XII). In some ways, this work can be viewed as an elaboration of the theme.<br /><br /><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="85%"><tr><td width="13%"></td><td bgcolor="#ffcc66"><img src="/static/quotes.gif" width="37" height="30" align="left" alt="(From the book) " title="" /><i>When I tackle a translating challenge, it is not in the least because I yearn to reveal to the poor deprived non-speakers of language X the hidden structure and meaning of some intricate passage in language X -- no, for me, translating is simply the sheer joy of trying to do something deeply paradoxical: namely, to carry off in medium 2, radically different from medium 1, some virtuoso stunt that someone else once carried off with great aplomb in medium 1. That's all, no more. It's just a game, an exercise in creativity, a challenge that, if met with sufficient flair, provides a wonderful esthetic reward.</i></td></tr></table><br />Probably the most important claim about poetry and poetry translation presented in the book is that in a poem, the form is just as important as, if not more important than, the content. At times, however, it seems like the author takes the extreme view of attributing form with a level of importance that shadows that of content. I would consider some of the suggested translations for <i>A une Damoyselle malade</i> to be new poems influenced by, rather than translations of, the French original. But the battle between form and content rages not only within the boundaries of translating that single poem. In some of <i>GEB</i>'s dialogues (perhaps most noticeably the <i>Crab Canon</i>), Hofstadter gave greater priority to form, altering content to fit its needs. Most readers will agree that this was an acceptable artistic choice. However, in <i>GEB</i>'s chapters (as opposed to dialogues), form hardly had an effect on content. In contrast, in <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i>, Hofstadter admits to have taken great pains to perfect the typographical layout of the pages. At times, the result is most pleasing (see, for example, the passage from <a class="isbn" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0316769487">The Catcher in the Rye</a>, pp. 282-283), but in general, I personally find no place for typographical issues having such a large impact on a book's content.<br /><br />As a book about translation, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> is sourly lacking. The decision to translate a single poem over and over again, while interesting, has imposed some limitations on the discussion. The poem is cute, and presents the would-be translator with several fascinating challenges, but these are by no means all the challenges a translator faces. Some issues in translation, like the translation of metaphors across different cultures, are hardly discussed (even within the context of trans-culturization). Yet as a book about AI for non-professionals, it is highly refreshing and entertaining, especially because of the unusual approach taken.<br /><br /><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="65%"><tr><td width="27%"></td><td bgcolor="#ffcc66"><img src="/static/quotes.gif" width="37" height="30" align="left" alt="(From the book) " title="" /><i>Indeed, one of my purposes in drawing together this book's sampler of sparklingly diverse translations of one tiny poem was to issue a clear reminder of how subtle and complex the human mind really is. I hope thereby to convey the attitude that in AI and MT</i> [Machine Translation]<i>, one should not expect full success overnight -- nor should anyone want it.</i></td></tr></table><br />Some aspects directly related to AI appear early in the book. For example, Hofstadter's arch-enemy John Searle (inventor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Room">Chinese Room</a> experiment) is attacked as early as the fourth chapter. However, the book begins to shine only on Chapter 15, <i>On the Ununderstandable</i>, which begins a beautiful discussion of the real issues at hand.<br /><br />One of the more interesting hypotheses presented in this discussion is the idea of identity-blurring and the interpenetration of souls. The claim presented is that each self, each soul if you wish to use that term, is not necessarily bound to a single physical brain; rather, it is distributed among several brains. Thus, in a way, when one physical brain ceases to exist, the person (or at least parts of him) still lives, in the brains of others. The idea certainly sounds poetic. Hofstadter realizes some people might claim the theory was developed as part of his attempt to cope with his beloved wife's death, but he points to some of his publications, predating her sudden death, which presented essentially the same idea.<br /><br /><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="80%"><tr><td width="12%"></td><td bgcolor="#ffcc66"><img src="/static/quotes.gif" width="37" height="30" align="left" alt="(From the book) " title="" /><i>Two experts, to explicate Meaning,</i><br /><i>Penned a text called The Meaning of Meaning,</i><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>But the world was perplexed,</i><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>So three experts penned next</i><br /><i>The Meaning of Meaning of Meaning.</i></td></tr></table><br />On the book's back cover, Daniel Dennett claims that for years, Douglas Hofstadter has been studying the process of his own consciousness, relentlessly, unflinchingly, imaginatively, but undeludedly. It seems that of special importance is Hofstadter's ongoing research of his own mistakes and linguistic slip-ups, leading to some profound insights.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0465086454">Find this book</a> using Wikipedia</div><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tr valign="top"><td width="20%"><div class="sideTitle">A Word about Hebrew Words</div></td><td><div class="sideItem">Hofstadter claims that <i>Hebrew</i> [...] <i>has valiantly sought to resist the influx of Western words for all sorts of things</i> (p. 295). He goes on to say that <i>there exists an official council in Israel that is charged with concocting official pure-Hebrew expressions</i> for some words, and he provides a list of fifty Western words like electricity, racism, tin can, can opener, and junk-food as an example.<br /><br />Of the list provided, more than one fourth have no Hebrew terms <i>in actual use</i>. For example, the word Hebrew speakers use for radio is simply radio (naturally, pronounced slightly differently in Hebrew than in English).<br /><br />One has to remember that the Hebrew language was revived rather recently, after several centuries of no daily use. It was revived in a heroic effort generally attributed to a single person, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Ben-Yehuda">Eliezer Ben-Yehuda</a>, which had to come up with numerous words to use in daily conversation. But since there already are Hebrew words for tin, can and opener, I see no point in using non-Hebrew terms for tin can or can opener (which are some of the examples Hofstadter provides). Other words in Hofstadter's list originate from ancient Biblical Hebrew. For example, the word for race originates in the Bible; it is only natural that that word would be used as the base form for racism.</div></td></tr></table><br />

<br>   <img src="/images/d.gif" align=left alt=D>ouglas R. Hofstadter, author of the widely celebrated ''Godel, Escher, Bach,'' has produced a quirky, personal, amusing, sometimes touching and often exasperating book about the mysteries of translation. ''Le Ton Beau de Marot'' does not offer a continuous argument -- Hofstadter himself refers to it as ''my ruminations on the art of translation'' -- but rather a long sequence of sundry reflections parceled out in packages of a page or two under boldface rubrics that are usually whimsical and often punning. This eccentric structure allows the writer to talk about pretty much whatever he wants to, some of it only loosely associated with translation. There is a good deal of autobiography in all this, with special weight given to what proves to be an affecting celebration of the author's beloved wife and a wrenching account of her death at an early age four years ago from a brain tumor.
<p>
The spine of the book, running intermittently through the ruminations, is a French poem written in 1537 by Clement Marot, ''A une Damoyselle Malade.'' (The French title of the book, invoking Marot, is a pun: it means ''Marot's elegant tone'' but is phonetically identical with le tombeau de Marot, which has the sense of ''a memorial for Marot.'') The poem is a charming social gesture, to a little girl who has fallen ill, by a playful, avuncular Marot, who encourages her to get well. It is composed in rhyming couplets, in lines of only three syllables, with the last line, ''Ma mignonne'' (''My sweetie''), identical with the first. Much of its appeal lies in its poised formal concision and its witty musicality.
<p>
Hofstadter begins with the French text of the poem, for which he provides four different approaches to a literal translation. In the course of the book, he proposes another 60-plus versions of the poem, the majority reproducing the metrics and the rhyme scheme of the original. Most of these are his own, some are by friends and colleagues and family members, a few (which he concedes are grotesque) were generated by computers programmed for translation. There are even translations of the poem into Italian, German, Russian and modern French (all of which Hofstadter then translates into English). The range of the English versions includes Elizabethan English, 1920's American slang, the diction of pop lyrics and the language of rap. Thus Marot's initial ''Ma mignonne'' variously emerges in English as ''My sweet dear,'' ''Honey bun,'' ''Sugar lump,'' ''Turtle dove,'' ''Chickadee,'' ''Pal petite'' and much else.
<p>
The point of this process of restless retranslation is to offer a kaleidoscopic view of the endless permutations of verbal, imagistic and tonal possibilities in transposing a poem from one cultural context to another. Along the way, there are some nice local perceptions about the challenges of translation. I was particularly struck, recalling some of my own struggles, by Hofstadter's notion of a '' 'rickety bridge' effect . . . in which a first spanning of a translation chasm, however modest, somehow facilitates further spannings of greater strength, substance and subtlety.'' But his generalizations about translation also involve a good deal of reinvention of the wheel, something reflected in the fact that of all the developing literature on translation theory of recent decades he refers only to George Steiner's ''After Babel'' and Willis Barnstone's ''Poetics of Translation.''
<p>
Hofstadter, who is a computer scientist with training in physics and mathematics, takes manifest delight in playing with words, has a competence in 10 or more foreign languages and exhibits a certain appreciation for poetry. This appreciation, however, has very evident limits, and these in turn skew what he has to say about translation. He understands little of the stylistic or imaginative subtleties of literature that are not expressed in explicit prosodic structures. He categorically dismisses all free verse as esthetically repellent and a betrayal of poetry. He is prepared to consign Robert Pinsky to the ninth circle of hell for translating Dante with slant rhyme and not preserving the terza rima scheme. He permits himself a 20-page tantrum against Nabokov for objecting to verse translation, in the course of which he actually characterizes ''Lolita'' as ''popular pedophilic pornography'' and describes the exquisitely lyric ''Speak, Memory'' as ''quasi-photographic.''
<p>
As a writer who has reflected deeply on artificial intelligence, Hofstadter conceives thought -- and, it would appear, imagination as well -- as a process of ''spotting hidden patterns, extracting deep gists, forming high abstractions, making subtle analogies.'' In consonance with this notion of thinking as the detection of pattern, he elsewhere describes his own activity of translation as coming up with English equivalents ''after a little poling-around in my mental lexicon and my bag of word-manipulation techniques.'' Word manipulation, in fact, dominates the book, which symptomatically devotes many pages to the exploration of verbal puzzles such as anagrams, palindromes, lipograms and acrostics, all conceived to be intrinsically linked with translation. This focus on sheer puzzle solving leads Hofstadter to a whole series of excruciating versions of the Marot poem because he concentrates almost exclusively on the word-juggling challenge of transposing the poem into a new cultural idiom while reproducing the original prosody. Thus: ''My petite / Pet, you're sweet -- / Have a hug. / Has some bug / Laid you up? / Made you up- / chuck a lot? / Knuckle not / Under, but / Undercut / Your disease.'' Intended to be funny, this strikes me as embarrassingly awkward, leaving nothing of the delightful Marot but the prosody and the address to a sick girl.
<p>
The ultimate weakness of ''Le Ton Beau de Marot'' is precisely the poem it has taken as its paradigm. The Marot poem is, after all, no more than a charming trifle, with the charm clearly inseparable from its elegant form. As such, it does lend itself to inventive transpositions to other times, places and stylistic registers. Some of these transpositions -- though clearly not the one I've just quoted -- can be quite engaging in their replication of Marot's formal structure in a surprisingly different stylistic vehicle, and thus they appear to confirm Hofstadter's contention that poetry can always be translated, formally and thematically, if the translator is sufficiently determined and resourceful. But what if the text to be translated had been a truly great French poem following an intricate metrical and rhyme scheme -- say, Baudelaire's ''Invitation au Voyage''? When a rich, imaginatively realized world is called up by the language of the poem, when the original words exhibit a sensuous density, a plangency of associative echoes, joined with a subtle musicality, it takes a good deal more than a bag of word-manipulation techniques to produce a satisfying version in another language. Even so accomplished a translator of poetry as Richard Wilbur was able to offer no more than a loose approximation of the experience of Baudelaire's poem and of its incantatory music.
<p>
Douglas Hofstadter has valid things to say about one-half the task of literary translation -- the juggling of verbal combinations and permutations as the translator teeters along the high-wire bridge from one language to another. What lies beyond his ken is the fundamental fact that literature is not merely an articulation of patterns but a deep imagining of the world through words, so that words themselves, in the hands of a great writer, attain an authority, a complexity of interaction, a power of enchantment they do not otherwise possess. To convey this deep imagining in another language requires, as anyone who has tried it must confess, more than even the most patient ingenuity.

				<article data-tags=""> <p align="center">  <em> Le Ton Beau de Marot:In Praise of the Music of Language </em>  <br /> by Douglas R. Hofstadter <br /> Basic Books, 632 pages, $30 </p> 
 <p> Connection, linkage: this is the great task of modernist aesthetics. &#147;Only connect!&#148; thinks a character in E. M. Forster&#146;s  <em> Howard&#146;s End </em> . &#147;The ordinary man,&#148; reports T. S. Eliot, &#147;falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.&#148; Douglas Hofstadter&rdquo;best known as the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning intellectual fantasia  <em> G&#246;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid </em> &rdquo;is an enthusiastic adherent of this tradition. Perhaps too enthusiastic. <br />  <br /> In  <em> G&#246;del, Escher, Bach </em> , Hofstadter used three figures from different intellectual disciplines&rdquo;mathematics, graphic art, and musical composition&rdquo;to anchor a series of reflections on such recursive structures as M&#246;bius strips and iterated algorithms, such self-referential statements as the statement &#147;This statement is false,&#148; and the possibility of building intelligent computers. (By profession a computer scientist, Hofstadter is a leading figure in the quest for artificial intelligence.) One of the minor themes of  <em> G&#246;del, Escher, Bach </em>  is translation: What does it mean to translate something from one language into another? Can Lewis Carroll&#146;s &#147;Jabberwocky&#148; be translated? If so, what would be the French for &#147;&#145;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe&#148;? <br />  <br /> This new book,  <em> Le Ton Beau de Marot </em> , takes up the question of translation in more detail. Several years ago, Hofstadter became interested in a slight, short poem, &#147;Ma Mignonne,&#148; by the sixteenth-century French poet Cl&#233;ment Marot, and started wondering how it might best be translated into English. What was essential to preserve in translation, and what could be dispensed with? Hofstadter sent a copy of the poem, plus his own literal translation and an enumeration of what he felt to be the key features of the poem&#146;s structure, to &#147;fifty, perhaps even a hundred, friends scattered around the globe.&#148; Dispersed throughout this enormous book are the responses of those friends, along with almost fifty different translations of the poem. <br />  <br /> Clearly Hofstadter saw the text of &#147;Ma Mignonne&#148; as anchoring his reflections about translation in the same way that the works of Kurt G&#246;del, M. C. Escher, and Johann Sebastian Bach anchored his thoughts about self-reference in his first book. But the poem is in fact too slight to moor anything so active as Hofstadter&#146;s mind, and he continually goes off on tangents that take him far, far away from the question of translatability. To be sure, polymathic digressions produce much of the charm of his writing: his excursuses on ambiguous newspaper headlines (&#147;British Left Waffles on Falklands&#148;), palindromes, dirty jokes, and various other linguistic games are funny and provocative. But when he starts telling us of his fondness for Wendy&#146;s Spicy Chicken sandwiches, or explaining that, on a visit to Cl&#233;ment Marot&#146;s home town, he bought some postcards and got his hair cut before he joined some friends for dinner&rdquo;well, one begins to wonder what editors at Basic Books do to earn their money. <br />  <br /> If readers can wade through the ephemera, however, they will discover that the key to his project, not just in this book but also in his research on cognition and artificial intelligence, may be found in a statement he cites from the mathe matician Stanislaw Ulam: &#147;What is it you see when you see? You see an object as a key, a man in a car as a passenger, some sheets of paper as a book. It is the word &#145;as&#146; that must be mathematically formalized . . .  . Until you do that, you will not get very far with your AI problem.&#148; Virtually all of Hofstadter&#146;s work revolves around this quest for &#147;as&#148;&rdquo;which is why translation is so important. <br />  <br /> He directs a research program on &#147;Concepts and Cognition&#148; that focuses on analogies and creativity, for the obvious reason that the creative thinker is the one who can find the connection, the analogy, the &#147;as,&#148; that links the seen and known with the previously unseen and unknown. If we explore what we do when we translate a poem from one language into another, perhaps we can come to understand how analogical thinking works well enough that we can teach computers to do it. And if we can do that, thinks Hofstadter, computers will be intelligent and the quest for artificial intelligence will have succeeded. <br />  <br /> But can we do that? Hofstadter easily punctures the hubris of computer scientists who think they have already achieved that goal, but he is even more scornful of philosophers who, like John Searle, think it impossible. For Hofstadter, there is no principle that makes artificial intelligence unrealizable&rdquo;but that has something to do with what he thinks human intelligence is. <br />  <br /> In  <em> G&#246;del, Escher, Bach </em> , Hofstadter posits what might be called a deontological theory of consciousness, one which holds that humans think by first learning and then employing certain rules. It may seem to us that our minds aren&#146;t purely &#147;rule-governed,&#148; but that&#146;s just an &#147;illusion.&#148; These rules that govern the mind, Hofstadter claims, express themselves through certain patterns. We recognize patterns and thereby appropriate (even if we don&#146;t fully understand) the rules that produced those patterns. Hofstadter thinks that the ability to recognize patterns &#147;lies very close to the core of &#145;pure&#146; intelligence, if there is such a thing&#148;&rdquo;and thus, since computers follow rules and rules produce patterns and the recognition of patterns is the definition of intelligence, computers can exhibit intelligence. <br />  <br /> It is not clear, of course, that mere recognition of patterns constitutes intelligence. Searle thinks it does not, and Hofstadter&#146;s many pages attempting a refutation of Searle attack the illustration Searle uses rather than his point as such. &#147;Intelligence&#148; itself may not be a particularly meaningful concept; Stephen Jay Gould, in  <em> The Mismeasure of Man </em> , has done serious damage to the notion that there is a single capacity that can be called intelligence. Hofstadter makes his work a lot easier by selecting one thing that computers could plausibly be thought to possess and calling that &#147;intelligence.&#148; <br />  <br /> But more important for someone who wants to understand  <em> Le Ton Beau de Marot </em>  is Hofstadter&#146;s linking of patterns with rules, because that is the source of Hofstadter&#146;s peculiar notion of what poetry is and what the translators of poetry have to do. He hates free verse, for example, because it follows no rules, and therefore has no patterns. (And therefore, by his own definition, must not exhibit intelligence.) This is hardly a helpful description of what William Carlos Williams in  <em> Paterson </em> , T. S. Eliot in  <em> The Waste Land </em> , and Ezra Pound in the  <em> Cantos </em>  were up to, writing poetry whose rich patterns exist even if they do not recur with regularity and predictability: their poems have patterns without discernible rules. Writing in traditional forms is no less creative; but the point to be made here is that human creativity sometimes involves the use of patterns that are not rule-governed, and the task of creating artificial intelligence is much harder than Hofstadter thinks. <br />  <br /> Two illustrations will help to show how difficult it is for the author to grasp the notion of patterns that deviate from rules. He has a great fondness for Vikram Seth&#146;s  <em> The Golden Gate </em>  (1991), a novel in verse written entirely in a stanza derived from Aleksandr Pushkin&#146;s  <em> Eugene Onegin </em>  (1831). But when Seth writes, &#147;How can I (careless of time) use / The dusty bread molds of Onegin / In the brave bakery of Reagan?&#148; Hofstadter thinks the first and third lines quoted need an extra syllable each, so he pauses to improve them: &#147;How can I (careless of fashion) use / The dusty bread molds of Onegin / In the brave new bakery of Reagan?&#148; Leaving aside the question of whether being careless of fashion is the same thing as being careless of time, we should still note that Hofstadter&#146;s mechanical sense of rhythm demands that a line not have two stressed syllables in a row (time-use, brave-bake). Of course, good poets vary stresses all the time to avoid mind-numbing repetition over the length of a poem&rdquo;especially a book-length poem. But if pattern-recognition is the heart of intelligence, and patterns must follow rules, then the disruption of pattern is a sin against intellect. <br />  <br /> My second illustration comes from Hofstadter&#146;s impossibly long discussion of how Dante should be translated. Notwithstanding the fact, which he cheerfully admits, that he has read none of the  <em> Purgatorio </em>  or  <em> Paradiso </em>  and only some of the  <em> Inferno </em> , he howls in outrage when he notes how few translators stick with Dante&#146;s linked  <em> terza rima </em>  in their English versions. Hofstadter can&#146;t imagine why none of the widely used translations of Dante keep to this form, and he thinks their neglect is a kind of betrayal. <br />  <br /> But the answer is simple: Italian is a very rhyme-rich language (in large part because so many of its words end in vowels), while English is rhyme-poor. The translator who reproduces in English Dante&#146;s rhyme scheme is continually forced into unnatural word order and peculiar word choice. (Compare Dorothy Sayers&#146; persistently clunky  <em> terza rima </em>  with the more flexible forms preferred by John Ciardi or Mark Musa and you&#146;ll see what I mean.) For the same reason, translators of French poetry into English routinely replace the six-beat alexandrines common in French with the pentameter that suits the rhythms of English. (W. H. Auden was right to say that alexandrines always sound comic in English.) Elsewhere in the book, Hofstadter acknowledges the difficulty deciding what it means to produce a &#147;faithful&#148; translation, but he is so insistent about how Dante should be rendered into English because the rule-governed pattern of the poet&#146;s  <em> terza rima </em>  is more important than euphony, clarity, or narrative coherence. But since the pattern is perfectly accessible to people who don&#146;t know a word of Italian, why bother to translate Dante at all? <br />  <br /> Of course, Hofstadter isn&#146;t really interested in the product of the act of translation, but the act itself. He hopes, by investigating his own translations and those of his friends, to understand better how the human mind makes analogies, and thereby to forward the quest for artificial intelligence. <br />  <br /> And on the question of why we should want computers to be intelligent, he says something rather bold and surprising: &#147;Why should a race of benevolent if fleshless beings be any less worthy of being considered our &#145;children&#146;s children&#146; than the potential gang of music-polluters, lyrical rapists, priest-assassins, and mob-frenzied jackbooted genocide perpetrators that might spring forth from the celestial union of my eager sperms with your equally eager ova?&#148; (Hofstadter&#146;s prose isn&#146;t always this out-of-control, but often it is.) Though he mentions his children often and dedicates the book to them, he does not seem to relish turning over the world to them, and he seems more willing to trust children he made than those he begot. <br />  <br /> Here again is Hofstadter&#146;s debt to modernist aesthetics: the poet (or the computer scientist) as rival creator to God. He never asks whether a group of potential &#147;genocide perpetrators&#148; is likely to create beings characterized primarily by &#147;benevolence,&#148; and his hope seems to be that we can make computers intelligent by teaching them patterns and make them good by  <em> avoiding </em>  teaching them greed. And if virtue were merely the absence of vice, rather than the fruit of spiritual and moral discipline, that hope might be a believable one. Alas. <br />  <br /> One thing more. A substantial portion of this book is devoted to a kind of tribute&rdquo;seemingly out of place in this context, but moving nonetheless&rdquo;to Hofstadter&#146;s late wife Carol, who died rather suddenly from a brain tumor in 1993, leaving him to raise their two young children alone. One is left wondering whether Hofstadter is perhaps envisioning computers as electronic companions who will not die and leave us behind. Hofstadter is at heart a Gnostic: he thinks of our bodies as merely the containers of our immaterial essence, and wants us to consider computers as potential children (and spouses?) because our sense of human identity should have nothing to do with our genetics and everything to do with &#147;something more abstract, something based on a certain way of thinking and feeling and caring, irrespective of the physical medium in which it [our identity] is embedded.&#148; A person&#146;s identity dies, Hofstadter thinks, because it was &#147;embedded&#148; in an all-too-fragile &#147;physical medium.&#148; Here again God screwed up, and we will not repeat His mistakes: If the AI people get it right, our cyber-children and cyber-friends and cyber-spouses may have to grieve our passing, but we will never have to grieve theirs. <br />  <br />  <em> Alan Jacobs is Associate Professor of English at Wheaton College. </em>  </p> <div class="social-share">

Traditional research interests: artificial intelligence (knowledge discovery, scientific
discovery, machine learning), applications to natural (biology, chemistry,
physics) and social (linguistics, psychology) science, and human computer
collaboration.  
<A HREF="http://vivisimo.com">Document clustering, search, and text mining</A>.
Data mining and natural language generation for 
<a href="/afs/cs/user/valdes/Mosaic/Postscript/associated-press99.pdf">sports</A>
(infotainment), politics, business, and colleges. For example: 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sci-disc/cmu.html">What's special about Carnegie Mellon?</A>
</H4>

My research goal is to improve on the current state of scientific,
engineering, and other professional reasoning by developing
characterizable methods and interactive software that partially
automate high-end tasks of discovery.  In short: Better discovery of
new, interesting knowledge.  But science took us to the moon, it cures
disease, etc.  <A HREF="filter.html">What does it mean to improve
it?</A>

<P>Important dual aspects of this research program are to contribute to
both basic computer science (creativity as an ill-understood phenomenon)
and scientific applications. The collaborative application of current tools,
as well as explorations of new tasks, are welcome.
<p>

I co-founded <A HREF="http://www.vivisimo.com">Vivisimo Inc.</A> in
June 2000 and served as its CEO for nine years and its chairman for
twelve, until IBM acquired Vivisimo in May 2012.
