&lt;p&gt;Agents are computer programs that have: autonomy, they chose their course of action without human intervention; proactiveness, they pursue their own goals; and reactiveness, perceive their environment and react to sudden changes on it. We have been working on the social aspects of agents when they interact through dialogues, in the area of automated negotiation. We have developed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructures for agent mediated auction houses, that is, virtual places on the network where agents meet to sell and buy goods acording to particular auction protocols.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic ---in addition to syntactic--- heterogeneity is an inherent problem for achieving interoperability in distributed systems if system components have been engineered separately and autonomously ---as in federated databases, peer-to-peer networks, choreographed web services, or multiagent systems. To guarantee an acceptable degree of interoperability in any of these systems, some sort of agreement on the semantics of the representation of the application domain is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We have been investigating how to tackle semantic heterogeneity with the objective of reaching semantic agreements by means of semantic alignment, understood in a very broad sense. Hence, our research focusses on:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mathematical foundations of semantic interoperability and integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ontology matching and mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;meaning coordination and negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interaction-situated semantic alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alignment of subjective evaluations of trust&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research in the area of computational trust and reputation mechanisms for virtual societies is a recent discipline oriented to increase the reliability and performance of electronic communities by introducing in such communities these well known human social control mechanisms.&lt;br&gt;
Computational trust and reputation systems have been recognized as key factors for successful electronic commerce adoption. These systems are used by intelligent software agents both as a mechanism of search for trustworthy exchange partners and as an incentive in decision-making about whether or not to honour contracts. Reputation is also used in electronic environments as a trust-enforcing, deterrent, and incentive mechanism to avoid cheaters and frauds. Another area of application in agent technology is teamwork and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed several state of the art models (ReGreT, Repage, Sierra-Debenham) and we are now working in different aspects of the use and application of trust and reputation mechanisms in virtual societies. Among other aspects we are studying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitive models of reputation and its full integration in cognitive agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reputation as a social norm adoption mechanism for virtual societies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argumentation on trust and reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration and use of trust and reputation mechanisms in e-institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;">Agreement Technologies - Trust and Reputation</a></li>
<li class="st1"><a href="/en/projects/research-topics/56" title="&lt;p&gt;Human societies have created institutions that set and enforce laws, monitor and respond to emergencies, prevent and recover from disasters, etc. At the IIIA we got inspiration from this human institutions for the realisation of open multi-agent systems founded on an electronic version of them: &quot;electronic institutions&quot;. Whose core notions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agents and Roles: agents are the players in an electronic institution, interacting by the exchange of illocutions, whereas roles are defined as standardised patterns of behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dialogic framework: the context or framework of interaction amongst agents of an institution, such as the objects of the world and the language employed for communicating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scene: interactions between agents are articulated through agent group meetings, which we call scenes, with a well-defined communication protocol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performative structure: scenes can be connected, composing a network defining the flow of agents within an institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normative Rules: agent actions in the context of an institution may have consequences that either limit or enlarge its subsequent acting possibilities. Such consequences will impose obligations to the agents and affect their possible paths within the performative structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also work on using 3D Virtual Worlds to facilitate human participation in Electronic Institutions. 3D virtual worlds are computational immersive environments that emulate real world using 3-dimensional visualisation. Humans participate in those environments represented as graphical embodied characters (avatars) and operate by using simple and intuitive control facilities. The immersive environment provides many possibilities for representing the system state, and the regulations defined by the institution. Hence, we are exploring how to generate a representation of the institution in the virtual world that is attractive and effective to support human participation. The aim is to build hybrid multi-agent systems, whose participants can be both humans and software agents, whose interactions are regulated by the institutional rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on electronic institutions can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://e-institutions.iiia.csic.es&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;">Electronic Institutions</a></li>
<li class="st1"><a href="/en/projects/research-topics/59" title="&lt;p&gt;Multi-agent systems applications in a number of areas such as e-commerce, disaster management, and information acquisition through embedded devices (e.g. wireless sensor networks) have generated a number of new challenges for algorithm designers. These challenges mainly take the form of very hard optimisation problems that are substantially different from problems traditionally dealt with in other areas (e.g. industrial processes or scheduling applications). More specifically, novel challenges come from the distributed nature of multiagent systems where the actors reside on different computational units and can communicate only a limited amount of information with their neighbours. Moreover, the agents may be acting on behalf of different stakeholders each with its own aims and objectives, have different computation/communication capabilities, and be tied to physical devices prone to failures. Moreover, given the dynamic nature of the application scenarios, effective algorithms have to provide anytime solutions and approximate techniques are often required/desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focus on the design of techniques for coordinating large populations of agents by modelling the coordination problem as a distributed constraint optimisation problem (DCOP). In particular, we mainly focus on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the design of complete algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the design of approximate algorithms that provide anytime solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessing quality guarantees both prior to the execution of an algorithm (at design time) and during the execution of an algorithm (run time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<li class="st1"><a href="/en/projects/research-topics/60" title="&lt;p&gt;The fast-moving advances on Internet technology along with more recent developments delivered by ubiquitous computing, are making possible a surge of emerging application domains. Thus, not surprisingly applications on ambient intelligence, sensor networks, virtual organisations, and P2P, to name a few, are nowadays the matter of intense research and development. Typically, these applications are composed of a wealth of physical devices and/or software agents that act to achieve some global and/or individual goals. The achievement of such goals normally requires the coordination, and eventually the continuous adaptation, of their components? activities. This must be regarded as a tremendous challenge because of the lack of a centralised control, the partial observability of devices and (human and software) agents (and therefore of uncertainty), the openness of the system, and the high degree of dynamicity due to environmental changes (e.g. due to varying types of failures).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, a fundamental question in this type of domains is how to achieve effective coordination among participants and how to sustain it over time. Notice that since these systems are situated in dynamic environments, coordination must be adaptive to continue being effective under unexpected (unplanned at design time) conditions. Because of the enormous complexity of such a task, we argue that it is fundamental to engineer these applications as systems capable of managing themselves, namely as self-* systems, where * stands for a number of properties: self-organisation, self-configuration, self-adaptation, self-diagnose, self-repair, etc. Since we can regard these systems as a kind of open systems, the multiagent system (MAS) view, where each participant is regarded as an autonomous entity, appears as suitable for them. Thus, we propose to engineer self-* systems as multiagent systems with self-* capabilities. In order to succeed in this endeavour, we focus on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; exploiting bio-inspired mechanisms for self-organising systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;engineering self-organising and self-adaptive systems&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Approximate reasoning capabilities. Uncertainty and imprecision are inherent to real world problems. The object-level of a module is based on a particular many-valued logic of linguistic terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex reasoning. Control is based on reflection techniques over a meta-language (Horn-like rules) equipped with a declarative backtracking mechanism tackling the problem of knowledge incompleteness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applications that we have developed with Milord have constituted a precious feedback to improve our language, for instance in the domains of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia, reumathology or classification of marina sponges.&lt;p&gt;">Expert Systems</a></li>

              <p>The International Conference on Extending Database Technology is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to discuss cutting-edge ideas, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences related to data management. Data management is an essential enabling technology for scientific, engineering, business, and social communities. Data management technology is driven by the requirements of applications across many scientific and business communities, and runs on diverse technical platforms associated with the web, enterprises, clouds and mobile devices. The database community has a continuing tradition of contributing with models, algorithms and architectures, to the set of tools and applications enabling day-to-day functioning of our societies. Faced with the broad challenges of today's applications, data management technology constantly broadens its reach, exploiting new hardware and software to achieve innovative results.</p>
              <p>EDBT 2014 invites submissions of original research contributions, as well as descriptions of industrial and application achievements, and proposals for tutorials and software demonstrations. We encourage submissions relating to all aspects of data management defined broadly, and particularly encourage work on topics of emerging interest in the research and development communities.</p>

                <p>Fernsehen √ºber das Internet (IP-TV) spielt eine immer gr√∂√üere Rolle in der heutigen Medienlandschaft. Gr√∂√üere Programmvielfalt, Fernsehen auf mobilen Ger√§ten, oder Mediatheken sind nur ein paar Vorz√ºge de neuen Fernsehwelt. Um das TV-Erlebnis f√ºr jeden Zuschauer zu optimieren ist im Hintergrund jede Menge Hightech gefragt. Das EU-Projekt ViSTA-TV erforscht das TV-Verhalten von Benutzern, sucht nach √§hnlichen Sendungen und versucht so, dem Zuschauer das bestm√∂gliche Programm zu empfehlen. Von der Lieblingssendung zu interessanten Dokumentationen oder die neuesten Trends - in der F√ºlle der Angebote wird f√ºr jeden Zuschauer das richtige gefunden.
</p>
<p>
Das Projekt ViSTA-TV ist ein Gemeinschaftsprojekt der Universit√§ten Z√ºrich, Amsterdam und des Lehrstuhl 8 der Informatik der TU Dortmund, sowie den Unternehmen BBC, Zattoo und der Dortmunder Firma Rapid-I. Ziel des Projektes ist die Analyse des Fernsehverhaltens von IPTV Nutzern um z.B. Empfehlungen von Sendungen m√∂glichst genau an die Bed√ºrfnisse und Vorlieben der Zuschauer anzupassen. Daf√ºr wird das Ein- und Umschaltverhaltens der Benutzer, sowie Eigenschaften des Video-Signals (zB. Werbungserkennung) analysiert. 
</p>
<p>
Eine Herausforderung stellt dabei die gro√üe Datenrate von Video-Daten, die in Echtzeit analysiert werden m√ºssen. Dazu wurde die Datenstrom-Umgebung ‚Äûstreams‚Äú, die von Christian Bockermann am Lehrstuhl 8 entwickelt wurde, um die F√§higkeit der Video-Analyse erweitert. Dies erm√∂glicht die gleichzeitige Analyse von Video-Daten mit dem dazugeh√∂rigen Umschaltverhalten aus Log-Daten. Die Ergebnisse werden dann innerhalb eines Empfehlungssystems weiter verarbeitet um Nutzern einen ma√ügeschneiderten Blick auf das TV-Angebot zu bieten.
</p>
<p>
Mit im Blick haben die Forscher aus Dortmund dabei nat√ºrlich auch die Integra-tion weiterer Datenquellen, wie DBpedia, elektronische Fernsehzeitschriften oder die beliebte Internet Movie Database (imdb). Im Sinne des ‚ÄûBig Data‚Äú Gedankens, werden alle diese Informationen zeitnah analysiert und lassen so auch Informationen √ºber Schauspieler, Nachrichten oder aktuelle Trends auf Twitter und facebook mit in die Empfehlungen einflie√üen.‚Ä®
</p>
<strong>Coding-Camp an der TU</strong>
<p>
In dieser Woche findet im an der TU Dortmund das zweite Coding-Camp zum ViSTA-TV Projekt statt. Dabei stehen insbesondere die Integration der Module der Projektpartner im Mittelpunkt. Das Ziel des Coding-Camp ist ein erster lauff√§higer Prototyp des Projektes, der Programmempfehlungen an Zuschauer √ºber Handy-Apps anbietet.

              <p>Im Anwendungsfall energie- und ressourcenintensiver Industrien besteht die Herausforderung darin, steigende Produktqualit&auml;t bei gleichzeitiger Reduzierung von Kosten und Produktionszeiten zu realisieren. Prinzipien und Methoden von Qualit&auml;tsmanagement- und Produktionssystemen nach dem Vorbild der japanischen Automobilindustrie r&uuml;cken dabei als vorrangiges Leitbild branchen&uuml;bergreifend in den Mittelpunkt. Als ein wesentliches Element des TPS leistet das Prinzip einer prozessimmanenten Qualit&auml;tskontrolle, auch bekannt unter den Begriffen Jidoka oder Autonome Automation, einen entscheidenden Beitrag. Jedoch ist das Jidoka-Prinzip im Fall automatisierter, verketteter Produktionsprozesse, wie sie beispielsweise in der Stahlindustrie vorzufinden sind, auf konventionellem Weg nicht ohne weiteres realisierbar.</p>
              <p>Ziel dieses Promotionsvorhabens ist die Entwicklung und Validierung einer Systematik zur Ausschussminimierung und Produktqualit&auml;tsoptimierung im Kontext starr verketteter, automatisierter Produktionsprozesse. Ein m&ouml;glicher Ansatz stellt dabei das Konzept der Advanced Process Control dar. Zentraler Gedanke ist dabei die realzeitliche, prozessdatenbasierte &Uuml;berwachung und Auswertung von Produktionsprozessen mit dem Ziel, kurzfristige Prozessschwankungen ausgleichen und somit die Produktqualit&auml;t sicherstellen zu k&ouml;nnen. Das Promotionsvorhaben soll f&uuml;r das oben skizzierte Produktionssystem einen Ansatz entwickeln, der basierend auf der automatisierten Auswertung von Prozessparametern entscheidet, ob die Qualit&auml;t des aktuell bearbeiteten Produkts den Spezifikationen entspricht oder ob und in welcher Form eine Anpassung der Prozessparameter erforderlich und realzeitlich m&ouml;glich ist, um die Qualit&auml;ts&shy;spezifikationen zu erf&uuml;llen. Alternativ besteht eine weitere Entscheidungsm&ouml;glichkeit darin, das Produkt nicht weiter zu bearbeiten, wenn die Qualit&auml;tsabweichung durch Anpassung des Produktionsprozessablaufes nicht korrigiert werden kann.</p>
              <p>Die Durchf&uuml;hrung des Vorhabens umfasst neben der Entwicklung des theoretischen Konzeptes, eine simulationsbasierte Validierung sowie in enger Kooperation mit der Deutsche Edelstahlwerke GmbH am Standort Witten die Integration des Konzeptes in die betrieblichen Produktionsabl&auml;ufe.
Zur L√∂sung der Aufgabe soll auf den Einsatz modernster Data Mining-Techniken zur√ºckgegriffen werden.</p>

        Please keep the Plone Powered link (or the plone_powered.gif image) if you use
        Plone on your site. It's a nice token of gratitude, and we appreciate your
        help in promoting the Plone brand.

        Plone is powered by the combined forces of Zope and CMF, two absolutely
        great systems made by Zope Corporation (http://zope.com) and they in turn
        are based on the best programming language in the world - Python
        (http://www.python.org). We owe these guys a lot, thanks for making Plone
        possible!

                        <p>Welcome to the Cognitive Computation Group at the
                        <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/" style="font-weight: bold;">Department of Computer Science</a>,
                        <a href="http://illinois.edu/" style="font-weight: bold;">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>.</p>


<p class="welcome"><img src="images/main_focus.gif"</p>
                        <p>Our research focuses on the computational foundations of intelligent behavior.
                        We develop theories and systems pertaining to intelligent behavior using a unified methodology
                         -- at the heart of  which is the idea that learning has a central role in intelligence.</p>
<p class="welcome"><img src="/images/main_approach.gif"</p>

<p>We attempt to understand the role of learning in supporting reasoning  and
other high-level cognitive tasks and use this understanding to develop systems
that learn and make intelligent inferences in complex  domains.  Such systems
would acquire the bulk of their knowledge from raw, real  world data, and behave
robustly when presented with new, previously unseen, situations.  These systems
can be studied at various levels of abstraction and  from various viewpoints. We
have concentrated on developing the  theoretical basis within which to address
some of the obstacles and  on developing an experimental paradigm so that
realistic experiments  (in terms of scale and resources) can be performed to
validate the theoretical basis. The main area of concentration in this realm has
been intelligent human computer interaction; specifically, natural language
processing and intelligent information access.</p>

<p class="welcome"><img src="/images/main_solutions.gif"</p>

<p>Our work spans several aspects of this problem -- from theoretical  questions
in machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning to  experimental paradigms and large scale system development -- and  draws on methods from theoretical computer science, probability and  statistics, artificial intelligence, linguistics and experimental  computer science.</p>

<p>
The <b>Center for Computational Intelligence, Learning, and Discovery</b> (CCILD) pursues fundamental research and research-based advanced training in algorithmic models of intelligence, learning, and discovery. A major research focus of CCILD is on the development of advanced algorithms and software infrastructure for data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, integrative e-science driven by scientific, economic, and technological problems of major societal importance in virtually every area of human endeavor. 
<p>
CCILD core faculty have significant breadth and depth of expertise in artificial intelligence, cognitive modelling, machine learning, data mining, and statistical inference, information integration, knowledge representation, semantic web, service-oriented distributed computing, algorithm design and analysis, theory of computation, and related areas.  They are engaged in transformative research on cyber-enabled discovery in collaboration with their colleagues in several areas. Some of this research is leading to fundamental advances in plant and animal genomics (e.g., genome annotation, characterization of macromolecular sequence-structure-function relationships, discovery and modeling of genetic interactions in development, aging, and disease), critical infrastructure (e.g., power systems) monitoring and protection. Additional collaborative projects are underway in Security Informatics, Medical Informatics, and Materials Informatics, as part of the center's e-science initiative. 
<p>
CCILD offers research-based training opportunities in cyber-enabled discovery to a diverse cadre of graduate and undergraduate students. CCILD faculty are developing, in collaboration with several academic departments and centers, innovative graduate and undergraduate curricula that integrate computational thinking as an integral component of scientific training e.g., as part of the nationally renowned NSF IGERT supported Ph.D. program in bioinformatics and computational biology. 
<p>
CCILD has a strong portfolio of productive basic and applied research collaborations (funded by NSF, NIH and USDA) that span all three major foci of the NSF initiative in cyber-enabled discovery: from data to knowledge (strengths: data mining,  information integration, theoretical foundations); understanding complexity in natural, built, and social systems (strengths: biological systems, critical infrastucture, theoretical foundations) and building virtual organizations (strengths: software cyberinfrastructure for collaborative e-science).

        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P>The Center for CILD  is directed by <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/%7Ehonavar/homepage.html">Professor Vasant Honavar</a>.</P>

Over the years, more than hundred researchers have worked at the laboratory. They have built a large number of artificial systems to investigate aspects of intelligence: knowledge systems, autonomous robots, machine learning systems, natural language processing components, design and implementation tools. Recently the AI lab has merged with the Computational Modeling Lab (COMO) headed by <a href="/members/ann-nowe">Prof. Dr. Ann Now√©</a> and <a href="/members/bernard-manderick">Prof. Dr. Bernard Manderick</a>.<br /><br />
	Today, there are two main research groups in the lab. <a href="/research/topics/evolutionary-linguistics">The Robotics and Language Evolution Group</a>¬†mainly focuses on the evolution of language and grounded communication systems. The core technologies that are under development in the lab are Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG) and Babel2. The Computational Modeling Group is active in several research areas, such as <a href="/research/topics/learning-multi-agent-systems">multi-agent reinforcement learning</a>, <a href="/research/topics/machine-learning-data-mining">data mining</a> and <a href="/research/topics/computational-biology">computational biology</a>. They apply machine learning techniques in a wide range of application domains, including telecom, medicine, supply chain management, etc.¬†</p>

The motivation of the tutorial is to create a community of experts that collaborate on open source grammars in different languages. Such an endeavor may have interesting practical purposes ‚Äî especially in domains that require rich semantics ‚Äî but is also interesting from a scientific point of view, namely how to operationalize cognitive-functional linguistics.</div></div></div>  </div>

The Artificial Intelligence Group at UCSD engages in a wide range of theoretical and experimental research. Areas of particular strength include machine learning, reasoning under uncertainty, and cognitive modeling.  Within these areas, students and faculty also pursue real-world applications to problems in computer vision, speech and audio processing, data mining, bioinformatics, and computer security. The Artificial Intelligence Group is part of a larger campus-wide effort in <a href="http://cosmal.ucsd.edu">Computational Statistics and Machine Learning</a> (COSMAL).
Interdisciplinary collaborations are strongly supported and encouraged.
