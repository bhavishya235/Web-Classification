<font size=5>
Collagists and assemblagists<BR>
gain new respect<P>

By <A HREF="mailto:zstentz@sjmetro.com">Zack Stentz</A><P>


<font size=4><P>
Chopping up existing works of art and rearranging their components to create new meaning is the quintessential late-20th-century mode of expression, which can be seen manifested in everything from the billboard ad for a pricey gin to the artfully "cut-up" wordplay of William Burroughs to the manic musical samplings of a rap song.

<font size=4><P>
So given the ubiquitous presence of the cut-up aesthetic in modern life, why isn't collage--and its three-dimensional cousin, assemblage--taken more seriously in artistic circles? "Oh, that's simple," says San Francisco collagist Winston Smith. "If you don't know how it's done, it looks easy."

<font size=4><P>
"There's definitely the 'I could do that' reaction from some people," agrees Mendocino County assemblagist Joanne Stephens.

<font size=4><P>
What these armchair artists don't realize is that while it may be easy to glue random objects onto a board or slice away and rearrange photographs from some fashion magazine, to actually invest these recycled images with new meaning is another matter entirely. "I go through literally thousands of images looking for ones that are the right size and position for juxtaposing," Smith says of the work that goes into his disturbing, often pointedly political works. "And I often paint around the edges to make the images match better."

<font size=4><P>
Smith specializes in taking the "Golden Age of America" images from popular magazines of the 1950s--happy housewives, pipe-smoking dads, atomic space cars--and rearranging them into disturbing tableaus of dreams broken and power abused. His work has heavily influenced an entire generation of up-and-coming collage artists, who encountered his collages on the album covers and concert posters of their favorite punk rock bands. "I first saw his work when I was in high school down in Orange County, listening to the Dead Kennedys," says fellow San Francisco collagist Robert Reger, whose works will be exhibited with Smith's at a one-night-only collage-themed art show Dec. 13. "The whole look of it has been a really big influence on me."

<font size=4><P>
Reger's own work often mixes collage with conventional painting techniques to create more abstract images. "I'll start by making an abstract painting and then collaging into it," Reger says of his creations, which sometimes resemble the fantastic backgrounds of William Blake with the flotsam and jetsam of everyday industrial life superimposed upon them.

<font size=4><P>
If anything, expect too see even more artists jumping on the collage bandwagon, as the advent of image-manipulating computer software such as Illustrator and Photoshop has made snatching, altering and juxtaposing pictures all the more accessible, though Smith and Reger both eschew the technology in their own work. And according to Smith, the object of all this high-tech manipulation often has been to artificially create the look of the old-fashioned handmade collage. "Photoshop has made collage really easy," Smith says, "and what you see in some magazine ads is the artists using the computer to artificially give the image a cut-up look. The 'Mr. Jenkins' Tanqueray Gin ads are a perfect example of that."

<font size=4><P>
But Smith does see at least one use for the new technology. "I'd like to be able to use color copying and Photoshop to scan images, so I won't have to cut them all out," he says. "Because the magazines I use are getting more and more rare, and I really feel bad slicing them up."

<font size=4><P>
In a way, the San Francisco show (appropriately titled Queezenart) represents the higher profile and increased respect being accorded to collage art. Smith's work has gone from appearing on rather obscure albums to gracing the cover of Green Day's latest million-seller, <I>Insomniac</I>, and appearing regularly in publications such as <I>UtneReader</I> and <I>Spin</I>. Smith tentatively is set to participate in a collage and xerography show scheduled for 1997 at San Francisco's Lawrence L. Hultberg Fine Art gallery. "I have friends who do collage, and I do collage. I've always liked it," says Hultberg, who is currently exhibiting the work of Stephens and other assemblagists in a show titled "Assemblage Barrage."

<font size=4><P>
Comparing the two art forms, Hultberg says: "Collage has never had the same status as assemblage, even though they have a lot in common."

<font size=4><P>
And according to Stephens, it's only appropriate that San Francisco be the location for assemblage's revival, given the key role the area played in its birth. "Assemblage was very big in the 1950s, especially in the Bay Area, which is as it should be, given that it's really the first all-American art form," she says. "It's been coming back strongly in the last few years. I've seen a lot of people doing assemblage in the Bay Area, in Los Angeles, and even in Orange County."

<font size=4><P>
Stephens' own work has garnered much media attention, especially the 7-foot-tall "Altar to Elvis" she constructed, which accompanied the popular traveling art exhibit devoted to Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe (currently showing at the San Jose Museum of Art). "People really responded to that piece," Stephens says. "It ended up getting photographed for the <I>New York Times</I>' Arts and Leisure front page and for an airline magazine as well."

<font size=4><P>
Like Smith (the two artists are friends), Stephens draws upon the imagery of post-World War II American popular culture (plastic soldiers, automobile parts, Elvis Presley, etc.), but her work often veers heavily into the darkly symbolic realm of medieval religious iconography. "I've been really interested in Madonnas lately," Stephens says, referring to the mother of Jesus rather than the dance-pop chanteuse. "And some of my pieces end up looking almost like ancient Russian Orthodox images, even though I'm using modern sources."

<font size=4><P>
As to the growing appeal of collage and assemblage in the culture at large, Stephens can only say: "As an art form, it's very reflective of our consumer culture, which is so dominant." 

<font size=4><P>
"And," she adds, in a particularly 1990s spin, "it uses recycling."

  USA, 1937-), <I><A HREF="../p/images/photocol_hockneymo.lg.jpg">Portrait
  of the Artist's Mother</A></I>, c. 1985?, photocollage. This
  is called a photocollage rather than a <A HREF="../Pf.html#anchor1212158">photomontage</A>,
  because it is more <A HREF="../Tf.html#anchor184958">three-dimensional</A>
  than a montage tends to be. Hockney reflected extensively on
  his process of collaging prints taken with a 35 mm <A HREF="camera.html"
  TARGET="_self">camera</A> as connecting to the <A HREF="cubism.html"
  TARGET="frame169270">Cubist</A> sense of <A HREF="../Mol.html#anchor6336751">multiple</A>
  <A HREF="../An.html#anchor1086797">angles</A> and especially
  of <A HREF="../m/movement.html" TARGET="frame169270">movement</A>.
  These &quot;multiples&quot; (as he called them) convey a strong
  sense of movement, Hockney argued, in that the viewer must keep
  readjusting his imagined viewpoint as his gaze travels from print
  to print. And of course by this means the viewer builds up a
  single image that is many times wider in angle of view than the
  camera <A HREF="../L.html#anchor4199503">lens</A>. (The viewing
  angle of a standard 55mm lens for a 35mm format camera is about
  45 degrees. Wide angle lenses increase the angle of view to about
  75 degrees without obvious distortion, but the human angle of
  view, with eye movement, is about 180 degrees.) This portrait
  of Hockney's mother illustrates the <A HREF="../T.html#anchor280958">technique</A>
  at close range.</FONT></P>

      <td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p class="txt-reg13">I love the tactile nature of collage. The ability to move the pieces of colour and mold them into shapes, the dramatic changes that come with each layer. It gives me great enjoyment to see someone looking at my work trying to figure out what has gone into the painting to create the texture. Things like sand, oriental papers and tissue, fabric, gauze, corrugated cardboard, acrylic mediums and gels, acrylic inks, acrylic, watercolour and crayons add dimension to the piece.</p>
        <p class="txt-reg13">My inspiration comes from so many areas. My husband and I have a long standing love affair with France and Italy. Annual trips provide an endless source of paintings in my mind. My love of flowers is a favorite subject for my photography and art and due to time constraints, I tend to plant my flowers on paper rather than in the ground. </p>
        <p class="txt-reg13">Living on the west coast also inspires me to paint the abstracts I see in nature. My Sea Fragments series has now spanned two continents taking in the Mediterranean. </p>
        <p class="txt-reg13">Working with collage and mixed-media is a freeing of the spirit for me and it has very much defined my style: vivid colours, bold images and strong textures.</p>
        <p class="txt-reg13">Karen Marcus is an avid artist, photographer and traveller. Through her photography and art she  captures many of the moments of her travels. A line of photography and digital art is available at: <a href="http://www.marcusmoments.com" class="txt-reg12"><strong>Marcus Moments. </strong></a>Her photography is at:<a href="http://www.photographybymarcus.com" class="txt-reg12"><strong>photographybymarcus</strong></a></p>
