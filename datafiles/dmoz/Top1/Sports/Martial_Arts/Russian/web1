        <br>
                   No rank, no rules, no pre-orchestrated movement, no limitations (except for the &quot;Law of Nature&quot;), Russian Martial Art is a
        system of education in human biomechanics and the study of human behavior under extreme situations. Students of Russian
        Martial Art are guided to introspect their vision to explore their full human potential. The learning environment is based upon
        ease, equality and enjoyment. Movement is natural and free, and acquirement of skill is based on the study of Russian folk
        dances, Slavic folklore, and natural laws of interdisciplinary kinesiology, biomechanics, and psycho-physiology.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   In Russian Martial Art, the main goal of a person is to render the adversary harmless while minimizing losses for both self and
        foe. Students learn to work efficiently in any situation that requires defense, prevention of aggression, or conflict resolution.
        This is how the Russian Martial Artist returns to the original Law of the community of life. Learning Russian Martial Art,
        students acquire great power as fighters, but more importantly as a human beings, increasing ones value for health and life,
        for both self and others. Both in combat and in life, students treat other creatures with awareness and compassion. When
        necessary, firm action is issued, but never in a callous or careless manner, and when all other option have been considered.
        &quot;You life is not your alone; it belongs to your friends, family and community&quot; (ibid. Alexander Ivanovich Retuinskih), or as is
        said in the Cossack Cadet Code: &quot;The life of your friend is always more valuable than your own. You can die yourself, but
        rescue your friend.&quot; This is the crux and cornerstone of Russian Martial Art: the preservation and harmony with the
        community of life.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The folk wisdom of ancient Slavic martial traditions dates to the activity of the proto-Indo-European nomadic warrior-hunters
        of approximately 5,000 BCE, passed recorded from father to son in families for generations of pre-Soviet Russia, and then only
        among the elite combat specialist subdivisions (&quot;Spetsnaz&quot;) of the former USSR. Only one Americans in history, Scott Sonnon
        was inducted as an instructor of this long, noble heritage in the attempt to bring the world together in fraternity. The training
        system, in America, for people of sound mind, improves quality of life, through Russian health system, sport science
        advancements, and elite combative preparation. In the year 2000, one of the sportive derivations of Russian Martial Art,
        named Sambo, will be an Olympic sport.<br>
        <br>
        <b>                                                            History of Russian Martial Art</b><br>
        <br>
                   Russian Martial Art has a martial evolution which can basically be divided into four periods of influence. The first period of
        influence can be considered the period of tribal combat. Predating the advent of recorded history combative sports and
        grappling contests were constantly being held, particularly during holidays and celebrations. The forefather of Russian Martial
        Art, these skills were passed on from father to son, and comprised tribal rites of passage, from childhood to adulthood.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Between the sixth and tenth century combative sports influenced the connection between tribal combat and hand-to-hand
        combat skill due to the incessant attacks from the peoples of the North and the West. In particular, a scholar by the name of
        Prokopiy Caesarean noted the Eastern Slavs to be fearless fighters, rather skillful in close quarter combat. During this same
        period, the Gothic historian, Jordan, also wrote about the Slavs being courageous warriors.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Not unlike the Chinese, who had their own patron saint of the martial arts known as Bodhidarma, the Slavs, too, had their
        patron deity, known as Peroun. Martial contests and games held in his honor, led to the inevitable creation of a Slavic school
        of martial art. The effectiveness of this school of combat was proven by the victories of both Mstislav the Daring over
        Rededia, the prince of the Kosog people, and of Nikita Kozhemiaka over a Hercules of the Pecheneg people. It is important to
        note that these sports were conducted without individual competitive success in mind, but for the mutual benefit of the tribe
        and for celebration.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Also, not unlike Chinese martial art, which were outlawed by the Chinese government during certain periods in history, so too
        was Russian martial art denounced, this time by religious groups. Religious prohibition, however, could not uproot the
        continued development of the Russian martial traditions. On the contrary, it was during religious holidays that brave warriors
        continued to compete in &quot;Wall-fighting&quot; on the ice, Russian fisticuffs, stick fighting, and other weapons skill.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The second influential period in the evolution of Russian Martial Art, known as the Norman period existed from the ninth to the
        thirteenth century. This period, with the refinement of metallurgy, saw many developments in the Russian martial traditions.
        Warriors adopted the use of the kolchuga (mail shirt) for body armor, the myech (long straight sword), the shelm (round,
        hemispherical iron cap) as helmet, and the long, almond shaped &quot;kite&quot; shield. The evolution that occurred during this period
        was a direct result of enemy attacks from the Western and Northern peoples. The need to adapt to this particular threat
        demanded the creation of flexible martial tactics, both in preparation and in application.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   With the third period of influence beginning in the thirteenth century, the influencial exposure to an Eastern, Mongol and
        Tatar influenced style of weaponry began to take form. During this time sabre, the Cossack Shashqa (long sword that is
        halfway between a 17th century saber and a 14th century shamshir [scimitar]), round shields, and eastern style body armor
        appeared in general use. A special Cossack weapon was also developed that is terribly lethal against the Eastern threat: the
        Nagyka (lead-filled short whip). The influence is most certainly the result of confrontations between the Cossacks (the
        semi-nomadic frontier warriors of Russia) and Ghengis Khan and his Golden Horde. The four hundred-year occupation of Russia
        by the Horde had tremendous impact on the evolution of Slavic martial traditions.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   It must be understood that this was an evolution, not an adoption or internalization of foreign doctrines, which took place
        during the occupation. For example, the Slavic word, &quot;yar&quot;, signified life's strength and its manifestation. Considering
        themselves descendants of Dazhdbog, the god of sunlight, they lived by a solar calendar and in combat they used their
        &quot;yar&quot; strength or energy, which was manifested in their solar plexus. In eastern martial traditions, internal energy or chi has its own
        focal point, which is located in the lower portion of the stomach, the dantien. Human biorhythms also followed the lunar
        cycles. However, this coexistence led to the eventual understanding of the enemy. To defend against an enemy, one must
        know one's enemy. Much was learned from this period of occupation.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   At the beginning of the seventeenth century the third period saw the gradual introduction of Western influences, conversely
        the influence of the Oriental styles slowly diminished. The continuing refinement of firearms inevitably led to the exclusivity of
        Russian Martial Art. The case being that it is much easier to teach someone how to fire a pistol, than it is to teach him how
        to be proficient with autokinetic movement (human biomechanics). At this point, skills began to be taught exclusively by old
        families that remained true to the heritage of ancient Slavic martial traditions.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   It is interesting to note that in Western Europe, Musketeers were distinguished and separated from spearmen, which resulted
        in significant disadvantages during battle; one warrior had only a defensive weapon or only an offensive weapon. For the
        Russian Martial Artist, whose training is based on natural movement, any weapon could be employed for any melee objective.
        This period served to fortify the exclusivity of Russian Martial Art.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Besides firearms, the Russian Martial Artist possessed an array of diverse weapons; the latter ones, respectfully called
        &quot;honest weapons,&quot; were preferred over firearms. As Suvorov's old saying goes, &quot;The bullet is for the fool, the bayonet for the
        good guys,&quot; and reflected one of the important tactical goals of combat--movements which quickly transfer to the venue of
        hand-to-hand combat, where the Russian Martial Artist possessed a marked advantage.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The fourth and final period of influence, known as the Global period, begins this century with the advent of the October
        Revolution and the introduction of the Bolshevik regime. During their regime, the Bolsheviks wanted to repress all nationalistic
        martial traditions of native lineage. The result of this was the creation of a group assembled by Stalin to develop a combat
        system and national sport that would unite the Soviet State under one combative tradition and one national sport. The sport
        was Sambo. Russian Martial Art is the mother of Sambo, but due to the influence of foreign &quot;tricks&quot;, Sambo soon became a
        mere curriculum of techniques lacking any high degree of depth and substance. At higher levels within the military, among the
        elite combat subdivisions of the Special Forces (&quot;Spetsnaz&quot;), Russian Martial Art remained in practice under the concealed
        title of Combat Sambo Spetsnaz. Even though classified with the label of &quot;absolute secrecy&quot;, the training was often referred
        to merely as &quot;The System&quot;.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The contemporary training of Russian Martial Art, culminating from each of these periods of influence and development, is
        known as ROSS - &quot;All-Russian Native Self-Defense System&quot;. ROSS is the national training system of Russian Martial Art,
        approved and recognized by the National Olympic Committee of Russia as the only representative of Russian Martial Art,
        within Russia and abroad.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The original royal family lines of pre-Soviet Russia, during the century of Soviet oppression, were not without alternatives for
        their sons. Entering their sons into the most grueling and dangerous military teams in the USSR, the Spetsnaz, allowed them
        to hide the ancient Slavic martial traditions under the appearance of &quot;Combat Sambo Spetsnaz.&quot; The sons of the royal families
        continued their training among the special operations units of Spetsnaz in order to select elite, trustworthy individuals with
        which to share the truth about the origin, nature and characteristics of Russian Martial Art. The difference between Sambo
        and its mother, Russian Martial Art, becomes easily distinguishable to the experienced practitioner. One family, the Golitsin
        family, survived the entire lifetime of the Soviet Union. Prince Boris Vassilievich Golitsin, in particular, trained few individuals
        including the Founder of ROSS, Golitsin's student prodigy, Commander Alexander Ivanovich Retuinskih. Prince Golitsin attended
        the induction ceremony of the founding father of the American Academy for Russian Martial Art and Combat Skill, Scott
        Sonnon, to give special insight and training and to offer his personal blessings to Commander Retuinskih's decision to induct
        Sonnon as a student of Russian Martial Art.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The Global period of influence dealt with the nature of combat during this century. Therefore, weapons adopted by the
        Russian Martial Artist included bayonet-equipped AK47 machine gun, the earlier SKS rifle, even earlier carbine, the spetsnozh
        (special forces knife/bayonet), entrenching tools (shovels), throwing knives, batons, military belts (used as whips and
        immobilizing shackles), pistols, sword (European sabre and Cossack shashqa), axe. The many wars and battles of this century
        are a horrific testimony to the effectiveness and longevity of the Russian Martial Art; its vanguards, the trainers and elite
        operatives of the Russian Special Forces, waged campaign after campaign with epochal success. This period of influence
        eventually evolved, once again, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union into a form of civilian empowerment and rejuvinated
        cultural heritage and pride.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The first non-Russian in history inducted into this heritage in the hopes of propagating this Global period of influence was
        Scott Sonnon, Executive Director of the American Annex to the Federation
        (http://users.success.net/karamazov, amerannex@redrose.net) and Executive Director of the American Academy for Russian Martial Art and Combat Skill
        (http://www.redrose.net/amerross, amerross@redrose.net). Now, a British Annex has been formed in the same hope of
        introducing Russian cultural martial traditions Great Britain. The legacy in the Americas is gaining potency as Mr. Sonnon
        continues to spread the message throughout the continent.&nbsp;<br><br>
        <b>                                                         Characteristics of Russian Martial Art</b><br>
        <br>
                   A metaphor for understanding martial art may be found in medicine: the two approaches, allopathic and homeopathic. The
        allopathic approach combats the symptom; the homeopathic approach amplifies and utilizes the symptom in the therapeutic
        process. The homeopathic approach is seen in very few forms of martial art, for it orients not on attrition, not on conquering
        and controlling adversary, but on non-resistance and amplification. The homeopathic approach does not resist force
        (symptom or foe). It does not impose force against force or resist force with subsequent force, but finds alignment with the
        nature of the conflict, empowers it, and guides it to resolution. Only three martial art forms appear to practice this approach:
        Aikido, Tai Chi Chuan, and Russian Martial Art.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The acumen of Russian Martial Art, as a result of the homeopathic approach, is based upon a unique amalgam of the
        concepts of non-violence, cooperation, non-resistance and plasticity.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   One could interpret Non-violence as being present in certain esoteric Chinese schools of martial art, in soft, natural
        movement, as well as in the flowing motion of the Morihei Ushieba's Art of Peace. In the coordinated search for harmony of
        Aikido and in the soft, sensitive Pushing Hands of Tai Chi Chuan, one can see indications of the homeopathic approach, of
        preferring internal force over external muscular power. However, Russian Martial Art differs from both the Art of War, which
        we have seen above, and the Art of Peace, such as Tai Chi Chuan and Aikido. This should be obvious for War and Peace are
        corollaries of the same doctrine. Non-violence is perpetually confused with Peace. Peace is the cessation of War; and War
        exists only in the culture of the practitioners of ad baculum (Might Makes Right). A bobcat killing a rabbit is not violence or
        warfare, though the doctrine of ad baculum would attempt to convince you so. A bobcat killing a rabbit is seen as violent,
        and therefore not peaceful, and therefore 'bad' or 'evil'. Since War is seen as an innate human condition, and not as the
        cultural creation it truly is, survival is misperceived as warfare. Non-violence refers to neither War nor Peace, which were
        exclusively fashioned by a specific culture of humans, not to be found anywhere else in the community of life. War and Peace
        are two wheels of the same cart, trudging along unstable in its anthropocentricity, ignorance, and doom.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Non-resistance is often confused with passivity and submission. However, once again, this is the myopic lens of a warfaring
        people imposing the One Right Way of Might Makes Right upon natural behavior. Also, contrarily, there is the opposite pole,
        within this culture, that advocate, pacifism (until a &quot;just&quot; war or until an &quot;unjust&quot; crime must be stopped, conditions that
        threaten the cultural lifestyle, but that were created by it and are inextricably intertwined in it). Pacifism is as abhorrent as
        aggression, Peace as detestable as War, since both are complementary of the same cultural construct. It is this culture, the
        Totalitarian Agriculturists, that only when situations are 'Right', expresses no need for 'Might'; or more appropriately, to
        ensure that situations stay Right there is a silent threat [&quot;Cold War&quot;] of Might, and proactive employment of Might to ensure
        future Rights. As long as this culture of aggressive/passive is not threatened, or questioned, and as long as all other
        viewpoints are silent (or better, extinct), there will be Peace. True Non-Resistance is &#145;going with the flow&#146; of life.
        Non-Resistance does not create force, nor oppose force. In this culture, societies go to War in the name of Peace. In this
        light, it is easily discernible that Pacifism is not Non-resistance; it is merely another form of resistance: resistance through
        non-action, the silent caveat of action, and proactive resistance to create a future state of Peace.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Cooperation is thought by this culture to promote singularity, when, in actuality, the true goal of Cooperation is diversity.
        Cooperation is not done in the name of ludicrous altruism, but simply as a matter of biological necessity. There is no concept
        of magnanimity, no mercy, nor of vengeance or righteousness. In the absence of the cultural paradigm of War/Peace, a
        dolphin assisting a human under shark attack is no more and no less noble than the rabbit who, though striving valiantly,
        gives up his life for the bobcat. Cooperation is only possible when we no longer attempt to conquer, control, and rule the
        World, imposing upon it the cultural concepts of 'good' and 'evil'. True Cooperation is only possible if we exist as equal
        members in the community of life. Our life does not belong to us alone; it belongs to the community of life.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Russian Martial Art is distinctly different from all other forms of martial art in the value of complete Plasticity. Not merely the
        absence of resistance, not merely the presence of cooperation, nor merely the position of non-violence, plasticity is pure
        adaptability, pure malleability. The concept of Plasticity is the appreciation that combat, like life, is dynamic and comprises
        infinite variables, both internally (infinite scenario variations) and externally (infinite scenario volume). Logic and research
        shows that survival access to an exact, appropriate response to a threat requires an infinite number of possible maneuvers.
        The most accurate, recent studies on functional neuromuscular pathways indicate that approx. 8,500 -10,000 repetitions
        would be required to ingrain merely ONE non-native or &quot;foreign&quot; bio-mechanic (physical activity not specific to a particular
        individual) into the muscle memory of a human musculo-skeletal frame. This is only for one &quot;technique&quot; (or called &quot;tricks&quot; in
        Russian Martial Art). Thousands upon thousands would be required in order for an individual to sustain survivability.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Therefore, Russian Martial Art reminds us that we are capable of spontaneous, innovative, original response to every conflict
        situation. A master of Russian Martial Art is, as a result, though completely vulnerable, utterly impregnable. Not untouched,
        on the contrary, the Russian Martial Art master maintains contact until a threat is inoculated (made harmless). The master
        absorbs blows effortlessly, contorts the body to accommodate the threat, manipulates through sensitivity to the subtle
        alterations in the application of the threat. The premise is that if one understands how humans function in the under extreme
        duress (Survival Arousal Syndrome) and if one knows the principles of survival, one can create innovative appropriate reposes
        to any conflict. &quot;No techniques. Pay attention to the principles,&quot; is the cry of the Russian Martial Art trainer.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   As the President of the International and All-Russia Federation states in the field manual of Spetsnaz hand-to-hand combat,
        &quot;All you must do to defeat adversary is stand there. From any position, any move.&quot; Survival Combat is too organic to
        compartmentalize it into regions of address. In order to move freely, unadulterated by abrasive designations of static training,
        one must see no barriers, one must possess no limitation, no impossibilities. Due to this concept, and in contra-distinction to
        all Eastern Martial Art forms, the center of gravity is not 'hara' (located two inches below the navel; called the 'lunar plexus'
        in Russian Martial Art). The center of gravity is the solar plexus, granting greater mobility and plasticity to the practitioner.
        Stances, as a result, are relaxed and varied, and as are there no fixed stances, there are no fixed &quot;tricks&quot;. No techniques, no
        stances, no sequences, no kata, no ranges, no rules....&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   As a result of the natural, homeopathic approach, there is a great disparity between Eastern Martial Art and Russian Martial
        Art in more than just operational strategy; there are differences in pedagogy and training methodics..&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   In order to return to the state of non-violence, plasticity, cooperation and non-resistance, the training process is more
        important than the product. In training, the Russian Martial Artist fights without the aim to &quot;win&quot;. This is a concept
        misunderstood by both practitioners of the Art of War and the Art of Peace alike. &quot;It is the fight for movement's sake.&quot;
        Strategy teaches to align with force, decompose the force, prolongate the application and trajectory of force, and redirect
        the force. Years of uncoordination and stress is unlearned through the rigorous bio-mechanical exercises of Russian Martial
        Art. There is no stress or conflict management in Russian Martial Art, nor stress or conflict reduction, but conflict and stress
        elimination.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   A heavy concentration is placed upon learning the principles of survival: the nature and climate of conflict, the doctrine and
        strategies of survival. Mindfulness is emphasized instead of mindlessness of the Eastern martial tradition
        ('mushin'). Mindlessness is necessary in forms of martial art that are limited to specific abrasive diagrams of behavior and movement.
        Mindfulness is available only to the philosophy that accepts no limitations in behavior.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   Due to an early understanding of the principles of survival, the Russian Martial Art student gains an early autonomy and
        independence from the instructor. The student, from the first day of training, exponentially increases in skill and mental state,
        for Russian Marital Art is not about Information, but Transformation. Practitioners of the Art of War and Peace react violently
        to hearing this fact. All of the training in the Art of War and Peace is founded upon practice of specific limited &quot;tricks&quot;, or
        rather on the monitored paranoia and slow-release of information.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The culture of the Totalitarian Agriculturists is based upon the concept of 'work'. Created by this culture, this concept states
        that the harder and longer one struggles, the more noble the person becomes, and more wise and enlightened and happy.
        The notion of 'work' is not advocated in this form of martial art. Natural activity is endorsed, which is our biological heritage.
        Russian Martial Art does not require the pharmaceutical accuracy of decades of long, grueling &quot;work&quot; because the student
        does not learn limited tricks, but concepts and bio-mechanics (how to become fully human again). The student is not taught
        some artificial creation, the student is reminded of the natural motions and natural happiness of children. This level of
        happiness is held in contempt by the culture of 'work'. Observation of, or participation in, Russian Martial Art conveys that the
        training is extremely grueling. However, the curiosity for members of the Art of War and Peace is that Russian Martial Art
        participants are continually, inexhaustibly laughing, smiling during training: during activity others would perceive as arduous
        &#145;work&#146;.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
                   The most violent reaction of the practitioners of the Art of War and Peace comes when they hear that the goal of the
        Russian Martial Art teacher is to share with the student how to teach themselves. Every student is an instructor. Every
        student is a master of their movement (our biological heritage), because it is chosen to be that way. Authority and mastery is
        not deferred to some external figure. Martial art is not something external to be sought (and &#145;worked&#146;), nor a curriculum to be
        learned, nor secret tricks to be discovered, nor massive brawn to be gained. Martial art is within each creature, natural in
        some, completely Forgotten in the human culture of ad baculum.<br>
        <br>
        <b>                                                           Benefits of Russian Martial Art</b><br>
        <br>
                   This ancient form of Martial Art is the Art of Survival. Students recapture natural athletic and learning capabilities, which the
        Totalitarian Agriculturists, the ad baculum attritionists, the seekers of power over others, name them whatever, believe to be
        limited to only the 'virile youth' who have not yet been introduced to the &quot;real world&quot;, the world of 'responsibility', the world of
        'duty and guilt', the world of 'work'. Mental barriers learned over the course of a lifetime are broken down by de-conditioning
        the mind to impossibility, by liberating the student from the oscillating paradigm of aggressive/passive behavior, by
        confronting culturally-imposed fears, by refining the natural awareness of the hunter-warrior, and by eliminating the
        culturally-imposed barriers to happiness, ease, grace, compassion, wisdom and harmony. The results of this training are
        incalculable, though marked by increased stamina, improved breathing capability, enhanced athletic ability, the elimination of
        societally-induced stress, the permission to be the authority over ones own mind, the permission to question and to doubt,
        and the development of a spiritual firmness and strong physical presence that is the birthright of all human beings. Every
        human is capable of returning to the Law of Nature, Russian Martial Art, the Art of Survival, is one path.<br>

<p>Welcome to the website devoted to <strong>Russian Martial Art</strong> in <strong>Serbia</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Systema</strong> (Russian Martial Arts) is a hand-to-hand fighting system, presently in use by the Russian Armed Forces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike traditional martial arts used for "sport", Systema is military based and current.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The merits of learning Systema are immediately realized by the "every-day-man" when one learns the tactical advantages of an efficient military based martial art.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Systema, the synergy of three components creates a TRUE WARRIOR - Combat Skill, Strong Spirit and Healthy Body.The body has to be free of tension, filled with endurance, flexibility, effortless movement and explosive potential.</p>

<h2>History of Russian Martial Art</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Russian style</strong> of martial art dates back to the 10th century. Throughout the history of this huge country, Russia had to repel invaders from the north, south, east, and west. All attackers brought their distinct styles of combat and weaponry.  The battles took place on different terrain, during freezing winters and sweltering summer heat alike, with the Russians often greatly outnumbered by the enemy forces. As a result of these factors, the Russian warriors acquired a style that combined strong spirit with extremely innovative and versatile tactics that were at the same time practical, deadly, and effective against any type of enemy under any circumstances.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<object style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="425" height="350" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/vRzdZoEqrp4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">
<param name="data" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vRzdZoEqrp4" />
<param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vRzdZoEqrp4" />
</object>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style was natural and free while having no strict rules, rigid structure or limitations (except for moral ones). All tactics were based on instinctive reactions, individual strengths and characteristics, specifically designed for fast learning.  When the Communists came to power in 1917, they suppressed all national traditions. Those practicing the centuries-old style of martial art were severely punished. However, the authorities quickly realized the viability and potency of the Russian martial art and thus reserved it for the elite units of Spetsnaz.  Since the collapse of the Soviet system, many other <strong>Russian fighting styles</strong> have re-emerged through training, competition, and media publicity. Among others, the styles include: Sambo (a wrestling style), Slaviano-Goretskaya Borba (StormWarrior Style), military style of A. Kadochnikov, plus a variety of folk styles (e.g. Busa, Skobar, Forest Warrior, Kozachiy Sploch, fist fighting by Gruntovsky).</p>

What do you feel are the benefits of the     Russian style to those of us interested in cross training? </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Hi SFUKED, I hope you are well. As for your question, the benefits     of using Russian style are many but probably the greatest is the flexibility     due to working on principles of movement rather than technique - this makes     ROSS versatile in any situation and can help in any sport or martial art,     as well as being effective in its own right as a combat system. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: I believe your     system originated with General Retuinshikh. Could you tell us a little about     him and how he developed the system? </font></p>  <p align="center"><img src="general.jpg" width="200" height="320"></p>  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">General     Retuinshikh demo's the flowing movements of ROSS</font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Alexander did develop this system, although it was already there,     hidden for centuries. He just brought it out and rebuilt it into what it is     now and made it more scientific and effective. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: Got any good stories     about the General? </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Yea, as you may know Alexander is a Master of Sport for Judo & Sambo,     also he had a reputation as a street fighter in his youth. When he returned     home from his studies the local guys said he had gone soft, all they could     see was dancing type collection of movements which looked nothing! So a match     (fight) was organised with the town's hero, a karate champ, Alex did not just     win I believe he played with the man. This and other similar situations gained     Alexander a following in his home town which was the beginning of the ROSS     story. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: You've just come     back from training in Russia. What was that all about? </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Myself and three fellow Russian martial artists, Frank Etherson     of Scot Ross a Police trainer and Chris Heath of Salford Academy, a Psychiatric     Therapist and Fred Turner a Judo coach. It was an important camp this year,     martial art masters from the world head of family sokeship council were present.     For me personally, this was the first time I had heard of these guys, but     each one was a master in his own art. The other big event of this camp was     the arrival of the Minister of Sport and other government officials. The Minister     was standing in for the Prime Minister who unfortunately could not attend.     A demonstration and display was given for the VIPS and all heads of foreign     annexes and branches (including myself) had to give a short speech. At the     end of this program the Minister awarded Alexander Retuinshikh the honour     of Honourary Coach of Russia. As you know, Russian Martial Art Federation     is the only Russian Martial Art organisation recognised by the Russian Government.     However, the greatest thing was to train with real Russian Masters again,     most of whom are serving military or ex war veterans. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: I heard Alexandre     Karelin was going to be there. Did you have the chance to train with him?     </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: No, unfortunately, he was not there. A very close friend of mine,     Konstantin Tinovitsky, Honorary coach of Russia for Sambo, said he was injured.     </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: How importantly     do you rate supplementary training such as weights, calisthenics and stretching?     </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: I've always done weights, sometimes every day, in my earlier days     I did some powerlifting and once won a medal in a National Olympic Lifting     competition..However due to my sport circuit training and daily stretching     is a must. I have found since I've began training in RMA I have become more     supple in my muscles. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: You have a reputation     for extremely smooth and graceful technique despite being a large and powerful     chap. How did you develop this (I only ask coz I'm not smooth and graceful,     as well as being small and weak)? </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Thank you for those kind words sir, as a young heavyweight I was     fast and agile (even for 20st) but these days I am somewhat slower (and 3st     heavier) although I believe the flowing style training in Russian Martial     Arts and regular mat work maintains co-ordination. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: You've competed     at the highest level in Judo and Freestyle as well as Sambo, care to tell     us a little about your competition history? </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Sure, .......5th Dan Judo 5th Dan Ju Jitsu 4th Dan Taiho Jutsu GB     International for Wrestling, EEC Wrestling Champion 1980 Olympic Games. National     Judo Squad Member, GB Judo International 3x National Taiho Jutsu Champion     5x British FreestyleWrestling Champion 9x English FreestyleWrestling Champion     6x Police '' '' '' Silver European Police Judo Championships1980 & Bronze     1988 6x British Sambo Wrestling Champion (1977 - 1990) 2x European Sambo Bronze     Medalist , 1989 World Sambo Bronze Medalist. 1990 Mr. Sambo (Moscow World     Sambo Championships) 1999 Awarded International Master of Sport at Khlampiev     Tournament Moscow. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: What do you think     are the relative strengths and weaknesses of these arts (vis a vis throwing     and groundwork) and what made you go with Sambo as your art of choice?</font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <font color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: The mix of different wrestling styles attracted me the most, although     it lacks some of the skills of Judo, (strangles are not usual in Sambo) the     lack of restrictions on throws and groundwork allow freedom of personal strengths     and with a jacket there is no limit. </font></font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: In the Russian     Martial Arts are striking and grappling kept separate or are they combined?     </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: "Combined, the whole is greater then the part", Khlampiev (one of     the founders of Sambo) said when asked " Which is best? Wrestling or Boxing,     Judo or Karate, how can any part be greater then the whole.'' </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: If they are integrated     what methods are used to achieve this?</font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <font color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: The 'ROSS' originated in Wrestling and Dance by using fluid principles     of movement for the untrained eye to see where striking/grappling ends and     grappling/striking begins. </font></font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: What weapons are     trained in the Russian style? </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: All and any objects in time of need are weapons, it is the first     and basic lesson. We just need to follow the principles to understand better.     We train with knives, sticks, guns, swords and even books, belts, pens, bags     and clothes. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: How much emphasis     do you place on weapons training and why? </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Weapons are an extension of the Art. Such training is dependent     on the needs of my students.(eg security staff sometimes require weapon defence     training). </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">SFUKED: Ok Matt, thanks     for taking the time to share this with us. Finally where are you based and     how can people get in touch to recruit you for seminars and so on. </font></p>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#000066">Matthew     Clempner: Email <a href="mailto:msclempner@formauk.freeserve.co.uk">msclempner@formauk.freeserve.co.uk</a>     </font></p></blockquote><blockquote>   <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote>   <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you     would like SFUK to interview you, contact us <a href="mailto:parkinson@SFUK.net">here</a></font></div></blockquote><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukmainframe.html" target="_self">Back   Home</a> ı</font></p><table width="75%" align="center">  <tr>     <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://worldvaletudo.com"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="judo"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfuklinks.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" alt="jiu jitsu" border="0"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukbookstore.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukmenubar.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="shootfighting"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/shimereviewdom.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="brazilian"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com:80/fsfuksubmissionfightinguksfukmmaforum"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="forum"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/fighting.html"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="conditioning"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/wrestlereviewdom.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="wrestling"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukinterviews.html"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="kimono"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfuksounds.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="music"></a></div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/webdesign.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="martial"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukbarometer.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="barometer"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukclublist.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="spar"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukfeedback.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="compete"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukmainframe.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="ring"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/sfukpersonal.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="kung fu"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://SFUK.tripod.com/azjudoreview.html/"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="reviews"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://pages.about.com/sfuk/submission.html"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="chinese"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Slope/9375/combat.html"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="training"></a></div>    </td>    <td>       <div align="center"><a href="http://pages.about.com/fcuk/fighting.html"><img src="../fist.gif" width="8" height="8" border="0" alt="running"></a></div>    </td>  </tr></table><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></body></html>++++++++++++++++++++<Over>++++++++++++++++++++

Rousey got the tapout 39 seconds into the fight with an armbar, the hold that won all of her previous mixed martial arts fights, including three amateur affairs before turning pro in March.None of Rousey‚Äôs fights, pro or amateur, have lasted longer than 57 seconds.She started this one with another rapid conclusion in mind. Rousey clinched with Budd and pushed her into the cage five seconds after the bout started, got the takedown 11 seconds later and quickly mounted her. Budd employed a standard MMA technique for fighters trapped on the bottom by using her feet to push away from the fence, but it gave Rousey space to isolate her opponent‚Äôs right arm and extend it for the submission hold.Budd rolled in an effort to escape or at least prevent her limb from being stretched, but Rousey converted the hold to a belly-down armbar and torqued the elbow further, then completely dislocated the joint as she rolled back into traditional armbar position. The arm was clearly popped out of the elbow at a painful-looking angle by the time Budd yielded with a tap.The definitive ending contrasted sharply with Rousey‚Äôs August victory against Sarah D‚ÄôAlelio, who claimed she did not give up even though Rousey and cageside observers heard a cry or yell that the referee interpreted as a verbal submission. The crowd for that bout booed the uncertain nature of the finish.No one could question the result this time.‚ÄúI‚Äôm stoked,‚Äù Rousey said during her post-fight interview in the cage. ‚ÄúThat was really good. I‚Äôm glad you guys are cheering for me this time.‚ÄùRousey, who plans to drop down a weight class, called out 135-pound former champion Sarah Kaufman. Although Kaufman hopes for a rematch with titleholder Miesha Tate, Rousey wants to clear her own shot at the belt.‚ÄúIf Sarah Kaufman‚Äôs next in line, please, Strikeforce, let me get a crack at her first,‚Äù Rousey said. ‚ÄúI really want to have a title fight against Miesha Tate. I don‚Äôt want to take a risk on her losing.‚ÄùKaufman defeated Tate in 2009. <img src="http://www.rondamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/rousey-budd.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="408" /></div>

Awesome training should be incorporated into cadet / officer DT. Need more of stuff like this. Recommend this to the entire department. Excellent common sense training. I feel that the department needs to teach this, because it is a more dynamic technique, which relates to our job. I loved it and want more! Fantastic.</p>
