				<strong>M</strong>ax Weber thought that "statements 
          of fact are one thing, statements of value another, and any confusing 
          of the two is impermissible," Ralf Dahrendorf writes in his essay 
          "Max Weber and Modern Social Science," acknowledging that 
          Weber clarified the difference between<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521397197/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="bk_mw_pol.gif" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="8" width="90" height="140">
				</a> 
          pronouncements of fact and of value. <a name="FOOTBODY_1" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_1" target="_self">1</a> Although Dahrendorf goes on to note the ambiguities in 
          Weber's writings between factual analysis and value-influenced pronouncements, 
          he stops short of offering an explanation for them other than to say 
          that Weber, being human, could not always live with his own demands 
          for objectivity. Indeed, Dahrendorf leaves unclear exactly what Weber's 
          view of objectivity was. More specifically, Dahrendorf does not venture 
          to lay out a detailed explanation of whether Weber believed that the 
          social scientist could eliminate the influence of values from the analysis 
          of facts.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
<a name="lede"></a>Did Weber believe that, even though
facts are one thing and values another,
social and economic facts could be
evaluated without the analysis being
influenced by values? And what is the
relation of objectivity to values? Could
objectivity, for instance, be used to
show that one value is superior to
another? Or does objectivity apply only
to the analysis of facts? Do one's
values or perspective stem from human
nature, metaphysical views, personal
identity, or is it just as likely that
they are a mere construct of culture?</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">These questions, and others like
them, underlie much that has been
considered ambiguous in Max Weber's writings: His
methodology. Since his death,
sociologists and political scientists
have been disputing where Weber stood
with regard to questions<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520035003/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0520035003.gif" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="90" height="140">
				</a> concerning the
relationship of objectivity to facts and
values. "Most of Weber's
commentators," Edward Bryan Portis
writes, "have assumed his advocacy
of the fact-value dichotomy, despite his
explicit and implicit assertions to the
contrary, because of his numerous
statements denying the ability of
science to refute any normative position
or to help one choose among contending
normative orientations." <a name="FOOTBODY_2" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_2" target="_self">2</a> Indeed,
hardly a scholarly piece is written on
Weber, it seems, without the preamble
that Weber's views on this subject have
been widely misunderstood, with the
implication that the scholar at hand
intends to finally set the record
straight.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">This essay has more humble ambitions.
Although it takes issue in the final
section with part of the exhaustive view
laid out by<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415084342/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0415084342.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> 
Portis, this essay does not
purport to set forth yet another
definitive interpretation of Weber's
views on objectivity. Rather it seeks to
shed light on Weber's view of the
applicability of objectivity by
attempting to answer the overarching
question that sits at the foundation of
those posed above: Was Weber an advocate
of value-free social science?</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The answer, as will be shown, is both
yes and no -- because, this essay will
argue, Weber maintained a two-tiered
approach to value-free social science.
On the one hand, he believed that
ultimate values could not be justified
"scientifically," that is,
through value-free analysis. Thus, in
comparing different religious, political
or social systems, one system could not
be chosen over another without taking a
value or end into consideration; the
choice would necessarily be dictated by
the analyst's values. On the other hand,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195004620/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0195004620.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a>
				<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521097851/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0521097851.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a>
Weber believed that once a value, end,
purpose, or perspective had been
established, then a social scientist
could conduct a value-free investigation
into the most effective means within a
system of bringing about the established
end. Similarly, Weber believed that
objective comparisons among systems
could also be made once a particular end
had been established, acknowledged, and
agreed upon, a position that allowed
Weber to make what he considered
objective comparisons among such
economic systems as <a onClick="window.open('../philosophy/max-weber-capitalism.php','new','width=530,height=800,top=0,left=400,scrollbars,resizable')" target="new" href="../philosophy/max-weber-capitalism.php">capitalism</a> and
socialism. Thus, even though Weber
maintained that ultimate values could
not be evaluated objectively, this
belief did not keep him from believing
that social problems could be
scientifically resolved -- once a
particular end or value had been
established.</div>

				<strong>B</strong>ut
first, just what is Weber's own
standpoint, as determined by his
ultimate values? It is, no doubt,
influenced by one of his key concerns:
"the quality of human being in any
given economic and social order." <a name="FOOTBODY_3" target="_self"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_3" target="_self">3</a>
Sometimes, however, his standpoint is<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0803975635/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0803975635.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a>
nationalistic. And in yet other essays,
it champions individual liberty. Indeed,
Weber's perspective changes, and it is
likely to be driven not by one value but
by levels of them, ranging from humanism
to a concrete objective. But the fact
that Weber had a perspective lends
little support to the two-tiered
interpretation, other than to show that
he believed it was permissible for a
social scientist to possess a
value-determined standpoint. His
treatment of perspective is another
matter, however.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">One hint that begins to shed light on
Weber's view on the fact-value question
is a characteristic that recurs in
several of Weber's essays and speeches:
Weber <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674001834/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0674001834.jpg" width="90" height="140" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> announces, often at the beginning
of a speech or essay, the standpoint
from which he plans to evaluate a given
situation or set of facts. Likewise, if
he changes his focus during a
presentation, he often declares the new
standpoint. In his opening remarks of
"The Nation State and Economic
Policy," one of Weber's early
speeches, he sets a precedent for this
pattern while unveiling a justification
for his perspective. The "inaugural
lecture is an opportunity," Weber
says, "to present and justify
openly the personal and, in this sense,
`subjective' standpoint from which one
judges economic phenomena,"
revealing that he maintained that even
the examination of such seemingly hard
data as economic facts were subject to
the influence of a perspective
determined by values. <a name="FOOTBODY_4" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_4" target="_self">4</a> When
Weber shifts course<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/3540634584/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/3540634584.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> later in the speech
to prescribing what should be done to
deal with the problems on Germany's
eastern frontier, he discloses his new
perspective: "the standpoint of the
German people." <a name="FOOTBODY_5" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_5" target="_self">5</a> The
solution would obviously be quite
different if it were made, say, from the
standpoint of the Polish workers.
Similarly, in one of his later lectures,
"The Profession and Vocation of
Politics," Weber tells his audience
near the beginning of his remarks that
he will expose "the political
deficiency of this system ... from the
standpoint of success." <a name="FOOTBODY_6" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_6" target="_self">6</a>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Although Weber often announces the
value from which he intends to analyze a
particular policy, he also acknowledges
that the value may be merely a construct
of one's culture or society. An example
of the influence of culture upon
perspective lies in Weber's comments
about political economy. As soon as the
method of analysis known as political
economy makes value judgments, Weber
says, "it is tied to the particular
strain of humankind (Menschentum) we
find within our own nature. ... The
economic policy of a German state, and,
equally, the criterion of value used by
a German economic theorist, can
therefore only be a German policy or
criterion." <a name="FOOTBODY_7" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_7" target="_self">7</a> Yet the
perspective still must be acknowledged.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Regardless of whether a social
scientist's value-orientation stems from
cultural norms, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521292689/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0521292689.gif" width="90" height="140" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> nationality, or a
worldview, what remains certain for
Weber is that the value is neither
intrinsic to the subject matter nor
specific to its context -- a view that
categorically separates value from
facts. Weber takes care to refute such
views in his discussion of the
methodology of political economy in
"The Nation State and Economic
Policy." First, Weber assails those
economists who maintain that political
economy can derive its own ideals from
the subject matter. The notion that
there are independent or socio-political
ideals shows itself to be a delusion as
soon as one delves into the literature
in an attempt to identify the basis for
its evaluation, Weber says. <a name="FOOTBODY_8" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_8" target="_self">8</a> "The
truth is that the ideals we introduce
into the subject matter of our science
are not peculiar to it, nor are they
produced by this science itself." <a name="FOOTBODY_9" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_9" target="_self">9</a> Rather,
the values stand above the subject
matter; they are of a higher order. For
Weber, it is less important what another
analyst's core values are than whether
he clarifies them for the benefit of
both himself and his audience.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Weber also criticizes those
scientists who often "unconsciously
allow the starting point for our
analyses and explanations of economic
events to determine our<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1859842755/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/1859842755.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> 
judgements
of these events," <a name="FOOTBODY_10" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_10" target="_self">10</a>
demonstrating that he separates the
subjectivity of value-orientation from
the objective evaluation that is carried
out after the value orientation has been
established. In other words, Weber is
chastising those scientists who allow
the subjectivity of their perspective to determine their analysis of the
facts. As examples of the economic
scientists who have made this mistake,
Weber points to the historical
apologists and to the Marxists.</div>

				<strong>W</strong>hat matters even more to Weber is
whether one adheres unflinchingly to his
values. In "The Profession and
Vocation of Politics," Weber
explicitly articulates <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039309040X/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/039309040X.gif" width="90" height="140" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> how one must look
at life from a chosen value: "What
matters is not age but the trained
ability to look at realities of life
with an unsparing gaze, to bear these
realities and be a match for them
inwardly." <a name="FOOTBODY_11" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_11" target="_self">11</a> The
comment exposes the inherent
relationship, for Weber, between
value-free analysis and value-driven
moral action, a dichotomy that
resurfaces in Weber's discussion of an
ethics of commitment and an ethics of
responsibility. To be "a match for
them inwardly" is to cling to one's
values even in the face of the
inevitable "polar night of icy
darkness." <a name="FOOTBODY_12" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_12" target="_self">12</a>
"For truly, although politics is
something done with the head, it is
certainly not done with the head alone."
<a name="FOOTBODY_13" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_13" target="_self">13</a> Values
are linked to the heart -- to
subjectivity -- as much as they are
linked to the head.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Weber himself seems to adhere to his
own values -- or at least he argues
repeatedly for the veracity of one
`cause' over another. Perhaps this is
among the trends that have led many
Weber scholars astray, especially since
"Weber feels that no cause can be
`proved', simply by intellectual means,
to be superior to any other." <a name="FOOTBODY_14" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_14" target="_self">14</a> Despite
his own attachment to, for example, the
values of individual liberty, his
"philosophical stance did not
provide a mechanism for validating
democratic values in and of
themselves." <a name="FOOTBODY_15" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_15" target="_self">15</a>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">How
can Weber's arguments for his ultimate
values be reconciled with the view that
value-free analysis can be conducted
only after a value or purpose has been<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521314267/criticismcom" target="_blank">

established? Lassman and Speirs, in

			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
				<strong>H</strong>aving examined Weber's views of the
role of perspective and values in social
scientific analysis, the evidence, both
from Weber's writings and from
commentaries on them, must now be
considered in support of the
interpretation that Weber took a
two-tiered approach to value-free social
science.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">First, it must be shown that held
Weber believed ultimate values could not
be proved scientifically, a position
alluded to in several preceding remarks.
Lassman and Speirs, writing in their
introduction to Weber: Political
Writings, address the matter
directly. Weber held the belief, they
say, that "there is no longer any
possibility of an objective ranking of
ultimate values or moral
principles." <a name="FOOTBODY_19" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_19" target="_self">19</a>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Weber's own writings support Lassman
and Speirs' conclusion that Weber
considered ultimate values and their
subsequent political values to be
subjectively<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0807042056/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0807042056.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> determined. For instance,
in "Between Two Laws" Weber
writes that certain communities are able
to provide the conditions for not only
such "bourgeois" values as
citizenship and true democracy,
"but also much more intimate and
yet eternal values, including artistic
ones." <a name="FOOTBODY_20" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_20" target="_self">20</a> The
language that Weber uses to characterize
these two types of values leads to the
interpretation that he held them to be a
subjective matter. Regarding the first
set of values, labeling them
"bourgeois" brings to light
their contingent nature: They are the
product of a class, a strata. Regarding
the second set, the labels
"intimate" and
"eternal" clearly set them
apart from any objective foundation. An
"intimate" value is by
definition personal, an opinion.
Further: It carries the connotation of
emotion, of mystification. Likewise with
"eternal."</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">This element of mystification, of
faith in what is ultimately unknown and
unknowable, materializes in other pieces
of evidence that help substantiate
Weber's view that ultimate values cannot
be objectively established. "The nature
of the cause the politician seeks to
serve by striving for and using power is
a question of faith." <a name="FOOTBODY_21" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_21" target="_self">21</a> Yet
here Weber refers to the politician, not
the social scientist. But could the same
theorem not be applied to the social
scientist? Could "social
scientist" not be substituted for
"politician" and, say,
"facts" for "power"?
And then could the social scientist not
be asked to use those facts objectively
while maintaining a commitment to his
values? Answering these questions in the
affirmative, which can be done only
through an argument by extension, a
frail but not hopeless step, leads to
interpreting "The Profession and
Vocation of Politics" as a metaphor
for the actions of the social scientist,
showing that the values he seeks to
serve are also a question of faith.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The argument by extension
notwithstanding, there is other evidence
that Weber held the social scientist's
values to be a subjective matter. Portis,
for instance, says Weber "believed
it impossible to justify ultimate values
scientifically. He presumed they were
derived from the metaphysical
commitments that define one's general
outlook." <a name="FOOTBODY_22" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_22" target="_self">22</a> Rogers
Brubaker, in The Limits of
Rationality, also acknowledges that
Weber's discussion of value orientations
amplifies those of a long line of
ethical relativists. Weber believed that
"value orientations are essentially
subjective, and that conflict among them
cannot be rationally resolved." <a name="FOOTBODY_23" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_23" target="_self">23</a>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Furthermore, Weber believed that
value orientations could not be
eliminated from social scientific work.
They necessarily determine the analyst's
perspective.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520056590/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0520056590.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> Portis writes that Weber,
in his Freiburg inaugural address, said
"political economy was a `political
science,' in the sense that it must
proceed from a value perspective." <a name="FOOTBODY_24" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_24" target="_self">24</a> More
crucially, Portis goes on to quote Weber
as writing that "`there is no
"objective" scientific
analysis of culture ... or "social
phenomena" independent of special
and "one-sided" viewpoints --
expressly or tacitly, consciously or
unconsciously -- they are selected,
analyzed, and organized for expository
purposes.'" <a name="FOOTBODY_25" target="_blank"></a>

<a name="section-Ruling-Out-Objectivity-Prior-to-Perspective"></a>5 Ruling Out Objectivity Prior to Perspective</h1>
		
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
				<strong>B</strong>ut
how, given this assertion by Weber, can
he be seen to advocate a value-free
analysis once a perspective has been
established? The first hint lies in the
quotation itself. Weber does say that
there is no objective analysis
"independent of special and
'one-sided'  viewpoints," a remark
that does not rule out objectivity, only
objectivity prior to a perspective.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">This interpretation of Weber's
position derives additional support from
other comments Weber made regarding
objectivity. Example: One of the
"deadly sins in the area of
politics" is, Weber says, "a
lack of objectivity." <a name="FOOTBODY_26" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_26" target="_self">26</a> The
objectivity, however, can engage only
after a value has been established;
otherwise, this remark is logically
inconsistent with Weber's statement that
"the nature of the cause the
politician seeks to serve by striving
for and using power is a question of
faith." The two statements, taken
together, imply that once a political
position -- a value or perspective --
has been established, the politician
must hold to the ideal of objectivity.
Furthermore, without resorting to the
two-tiered interpretation of Weber's view
of value-free social science, it would
be difficult to reconcile Weber's
comment that a lack of objectivity is a
sin with the comment that there is no
objective analysis independent of
special viewpoints.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Lassman and Speirs supply another
piece of evidence for the view that
Weber believed a subjective end had to
be established before objective analysis
could proceed. They write: "The
`disenchantment' that Weber described
did not stop with liberalism. The
traditional philosophical foundations of
all political ideologies and doctrines
were threatened by a relentless
undermining of their own
presuppositions." This extract
reveals that Weber, at least in Lassman
and Speirs' view, was interested in
analyzing from an objective viewpoint
the makeup of various political systems
-- but it also shows that the objective
analysis could only be carried out once
the purpose of the system, i.e., the
ultimate value upon which it is based,
is identified and acknowledged.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Thus
it seems, both by default and
implication, that Weber believed the
political analyst could adhere to the
principle of objectivity once an value
or perspective had been laid out. In
this regard, Weber departs from -- or
rather builds upon -- the philosophy of
social science laid out by Friedrich
Nietzsche,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140150625/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="../images/0140150625.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">

					<img border="0" src="../images/0140443290.gif" width="90" height="140" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">
				</a> whose thought influenced
Weber. Nietzsche's perspectivism
maintains that all interpretation is
necessarily mediated by perspective,
making analysis unavoidably laden with
biases, presuppositions, values, and so
forth. Weber builds on Nietzsche's
perspectivism by maintaining that
objectivity is still possible -- but
only after a particular perspective,
value, or end has been established. For
the politician, the question of value is
a choice of a faith; but once it is
made, it should be pursued by objective
means. For the social scientist, value
necessarily determines perspective and
influences the facts chosen for
analysis, but once those decisions are
made, the social scientist is bound by
the principle of objectivity.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The work of Weber scholars supports
this conclusion. Brubaker, for instance,
affirms the two-tiered interpretation of
Weber's view regarding objectivity:<a name="FOOTBODY_27" target="_blank"></a>
			</div>
			<blockquote>"The selection of means to a
given end can be assessed in terms of
its objective rationality, since it is
possible to discriminate objectively --
for Weber, scientifically -- between
adequate and inadequate means. But the
notion of objective rationality does not
apply to wertrational action --
to action conceived as intrinsically
rather than as instrumentally valuable,
as an end in itself rather than as means
to some further end." 
				27
			</blockquote>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Portis agrees, writing that Weber
came to believe that empirical methods,
in social science, could distinguish
between true and false beliefs only when
researchers took a distinct orientation
toward their own ultimate values. <a name="FOOTBODY_28" target="_blank"></a>

			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
				<strong>O</strong>n another level, however, Portis
also argues that Weber nevertheless
maintained that political activity and
social science are incompatible
pursuits, and this is where Portis'
interpretation of Weber's thought on
objectivity goes afoul.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Weber, he says, "denied that
objectivity would be equated with
impersonality or that it was possible
for thought to be compartmentalized into
normative and objective
categories." <a name="FOOTBODY_29" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_29" target="_self">29</a>
			</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">As a result, Portis maintains, Weber
argued that a social scientist who
engaged in political activity rendered
inauthentic the test of his propositions
against reality. Thus, Weber's
perspective, Portis contends, is that
politics are autonomous from science
both in principle and in practice.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Portis is partly right. Yet he is
also partly wrong. He accurately
portrays Weber's first-level view that
denies the existence of either positive
or natural law, affirming the fact-value
dichotomy: "The categories through
which social phenomena are perceived
must be radically subjective, derived
from priorities that the investigator
brings to work rather than universal
laws discovered through systematic
observation." <a name="FOOTBODY_30" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_30" target="_self">30</a> Portis,
however, soon goes astray -- or just
does not go far enough -- in
characterizing Weber's view of the
fact-value dichotomy: "Because
these categories are antecedent to
social scientific analysis, social
problems cannot be scientifically
resolved." <a name="FOOTBODY_31" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_31" target="_self">31</a> True,
Weber would agree, categories must be
established prior to analysis. Once
established, these categories also
entail ends, and it is by working
objectively toward those ends that
allows the social scientist to resolve a
given social problem scientifically.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Moreover, if one accepts Weber's view
that objectivity can be applied to
social and economic problems only after
a distinct value orientation has been
established, it follows that political
action does not corrupt a social
scientist's objectivity as long as the
scientist's perspective or values are
explicitly acknowledged.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The crucial element that Portis
overlooks is that by choosing
categories, by establishing a value
prior to analysis, as the social
scientist must, he is necessarily making
decisions that are inherently political
in nature. Given this, the converse of Portis' conclusion in fact holds: That a
social scientist cannot engage in
objective analysis without taking
overt political action, because the
choice of values is itself a political
act. From this it follows that <a href="../cc/kudos.php#section-Robert-D.-Putnam-Cites-Essay-on-Weber">science
and politics are, for Weber, not
mutually exclusive; rather, they are
mutually inclusive</a>. The social
scientist cannot proceed with objective
analysis until after his values or
perspective have been established, an
act which is political, whether
conscious or not, whether announced to
others or not.</div>

			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
				<strong>T</strong>hus,
despite Portis' ideal vision of Weber's
thought to the contrary, social science
and political activity are compatible:
The social scientist, in conducting
research and analyzing facts, is
necessarily influenced by his political
position, at least to the extent
determined by his ultimate values. Weber
knew this, and exhorted his fellow
social scientists to clarify both for
themselves and for others the values
driving their investigations. Such a
clarification is the prerequisite to
objective analysis of facts with a
particular purpose or value in mind.</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Furthermore, again despite Portis'
claims to the contrary, part of the
power and allure of Weber lies in the
dual legacy that he handed down: He
succeeded, at least in the totality of
his work, in being overtly<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521397197/criticismcom" target="_blank">
					<img border="0" src="bk_mw_pol.gif" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="90" height="140">
				</a> political
while remaining true to his integrity as
a social scientist. At least one work by
Weber -- his short essay titled
"The President of the Reich"
-- directly bears this out. And even if,
as Portis argues, Weber did become
psychologically tormented by the tension
he felt between his need to voice his
political views and his need to feel
integrity as a social scientist, what
allowed him, in the end, to succeed in
being both political and scientific was
his two-tiered approach to value-free
social science.
			</div>
			<div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Weber sees the damage inherent in
failing to openly acknowledge one's
values, and the even greater danger in
falling prey to the delusion that the
analyst can evaluate social facts
completely independent of own values.
Weber sums up this position in "The
Nation State and Economic Policy":
"We in particular succumb readily
to a special kind of illusion, namely
that we are able to refrain entirely
from making conscious value judgements
of our own." <a name="FOOTBODY_32" target="_blank"></a>
				<a href="#FOOTNOTE_32" target="_self">32</a> In
other words, when the analyst fails to
clarify and consciously acknowledge his
values, it is unlikely that he can
conduct the subsequent analysis
impartially. The acknowledgement of a
value orientation is the prerequisite to
objective evaluation.</div>

		<p>We use our construct systems to make the world easier to find our way around.
<!-- google_ad_section_start(weight=ignore) -->
Because we know that countries closer to the Equator are hotter than those at the Poles, we can make a better job of packing what to take to a journey to Mexico. Because we know that cars built in the 1970's were not built with economy in mind, we know better than to make fuel consumption the deciding criterion when looking to buy an old banger.
<!-- google_ad_section_end -->
If we know that when our partner behaves in a particular way it usually means that they're feeling preoccupied, or loving, or harassed, then we adjust our expectations and our behaviour accordingly. Our construct systems reflect our constant efforts to make sense of our world, just as scientists make sense of their subject-matter: we observe, we draw conclusions about patterns of cause and effect, and we behave according to those conclusions.</p>
		<h4><a name="change">Our construct systems can grow and change:</a></h4>
		<p>Our construct systems are not static. They are confirmed or challenged every moment we are conscious.
<!-- google_ad_section_start(weight=ignore) -->
If we believe that Arctic Airlines offers the best service in the world, and then we have a dreadful trip where everything goes wrong, we do one of two things: we either
<!-- google_ad_section_end -->
<em>adapt</em> our construct system, altering our feelings about them in the light of our experience; or we <em>immunise</em> our construct system, with thoughts like <em>They must have been having a really bad day,</em> or <em>Yes, but the airport was so overcrowded they didn't stand a chance.</em> Whether we adapt or immunise depends on a number of things: how open we are to new information, how much it matters to us to maintain our belief in the superiority of Arctic Airlines, how important it is to us to have a lot of information about airlines anyway.</p>
		<h4><a name="perceptions">Our construct systems influence our expectations and perceptions:</a></h4>
<!-- google_ad_section_start(weight=ignore) -->
		<p>Also, if we're expecting Arctic Airlines to treat us well, we probably get on the plane in a better mood than we would on an airline which gave us poor treatment last time. If our experience is that Arctic's cabin staff always smile when they meet us, we probably board the plane with a smile ourselves. We might not notice when Arctic's service fails to live up to standard, but pay attention when it happens with the other airline.
<!-- google_ad_section_end -->
Because our construct systems reflect our past experience, they also influence our expectations and behaviour. </p>
		<h4><a name="important">Some constructs, and some aspects of our construct systems, are more important than others:</a></h4>
		<p>The airline example repeats in every area of our experience. We feel, think, and behave according to our construct system; we adapt our constructs, immunise them, or have them confirmed. Some of our constructs - those which represent our core values and concern our key relationships - are complex, quite firmly fixed, wide-ranging, and difficult to change; others, about things which don't matter so much, or about which we haven't much experience, are simpler, narrower, and carry less personal commitment. </p>
		<h4><a name="experience">Your construct system is your truth as you understand and experience it - nobody else's:</a></h4>
		<p>A person's construct system represents the truth <em>as they understand it.</em> Construct systems cannot be judged in terms of their objective truth - whatever 'objective' means in the world of personal feelings and choices. When we meet someone whose construct system is different from our own - especially if we don't like it, or think it's wrong - we sometimes use words like <em>prejudice</em> or <em>stereotype</em> to convey our disagreement. We might try confronting them with opposing opinions or evidence, and get frustrated if we see them immunising their constructs instead of adapting them. But we have to accept that their system has worked, more or less, for them so far, and that if it is different from ours then that is a reflection of the fact that they've had different experiences, different reactions, and see different things as important.</p>
		<h4><a name="consistent">Construct systems are not always internally consistent:</a></h4>
		<p>People can and do live with a degree of internal inconsistency within their construct systems. At the simplest level, many of us encounter this as small children when we hear an adult say 'This hurts me more than it hurts you,' and wonder why, under those circumstances, they don't stop doing it. At the more complex level, we observe this when we encounter someone whose self-perception seems to be at odds with reality, who seems to present different faces in different circumstances. Most people live with a certain level of inconsistency which does them no harm; but when the distortions of judgement become too costly or inappropriate the person (and/or those around them) is likely to suffer some form of personal distress.</p>
		<h4><a name="empathy">The extent to which one person can understand another's construct system is a measure of that person's empathy:</a></h4>
		<p>You do not have to have the same construct system as another person in order to understand them; but you do have to be able to infer the other person's construct system. The simple example is when one mate says to another 'After a day like you've just had, I thought you'd like chicken soup,' and is rewarded with a grateful smile. Most of the advice on how to get on with other people, for whatever purpose, is reducible to the prayer to the Blessed Spirit to grant that I might not condemn my neighbour until I have walked a mile in his moccasins - or, as Kelly might have put it, his construct system.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Application</h2>
		<h4><a name="Mathematical">Mathematical representations of construct systems</a></h4>
		<p>Kelly conceived of construct systems as multi-dimensional mathematical models in which the person's own language is used to classify his or her experience. In his theoretical work, he and his followers developed a number of mathematical representations of construct systems, which they used to test some of the hypotheses which followed from his basic personal construct theory.</p>
		<h4><a name="Interview">The Repertory Grid Interview</a></h4>
		<p>Kelly also searched for a way of getting people to reveal their construct system. Repertory Grid interviewing technique was the answer (although he originally called it the Role Construct Repertory Test). The term <em>repertory</em> derives, of course, from <em>repertoire</em> - the repertoire of constructs which the person had developed. Because constructs represent some form of judgement or evaluation, by definition they are scalar: that is, the concept <em>good</em> can only exist in contrast to the concept <em>bad</em>, the concept <em>gentle</em> can only exist as a contrast to the concept <em>harsh</em>. Any evaluation we make - when we describe a car as <em>sporty</em>, or a politician as <em>right-wing</em>, or a sore toe as <em>painful</em> - could reasonably be answered with the question 'Compared with what?' The process of taking three elements and asking for two of them to be paired in contrast with the third is the most efficient way in which the two poles of the construct can be elicited.</p>
		<h4><a name="relationships">Application to personal experiences and relationships</a></h4>
		<p>Being a clinician, Kelly mostly concerned himself with his patients' personal experiences and relationships; so he worked largely with what we would now call 'significant others' as elements - parents and relations, friends, colleagues, the self. He would discover the important elements, elicit the patient's constructs, have the elements rated on the constructs, and use the resulting grid to help the patient understand his or her key issues, to decide priorities for therapy, and to track the progress of therapy. </p>
		<p>If you had eavesdropped on one of Kelly's sessions, you might had heard him discussing with the patient the distance between the two elements MYSELF and MYSELF AS MY FATHER WOULD LIKE ME TO BE - and then go on to discuss whose problem was it, did it matter, what needed to happen to reduce it if it did matter? You might have heard Kelly reflecting back the patient's self-description and working through ways of making it happier, more competent, less compulsed. You might have heard him, if his analysis of the themes of the constructs suggested it, reflecting back that most of the constructs could be summarised as <em>takes my side - always against me</em> and preparing an appropriate therapeutic intervention for one who appears paranoid.</p>

The Android phones and devices filled the emptiness (Void) of over 10 week delivery-time of the iPhone 4 last summer. Also the antenna-problems (which obviously was a design flaw) didn&#039;t help much either. The new HTC (Desire Z) and Samsung Galaxy S (and Samsung Galaxy Tab) are good alternative candidates.I now have a Kindle (3G + WiFi)  for reading books and my PDF-documents, but the combination of listening to a specific audio-lesson in MP3 and reading the corresponding PDF does not work well. Searching through documents on my iPhone does not work as convenient as my desktop or laptop and (for what I heard the iPad does not do that either, unless you put these documents in Google Docs or a specific app). The fact that Flash is not supported feels a bit like cutting off a large part of the Internet-content. I could use a remote viewing app like Teamviewer to work on my desktop with my iPhone, but this is improvising. Rumors say the iPhone 5 might come out in april 2011 and the new iPad 2 (with camera&#039;s) even sooner in February 2011. Since the price of the iPhone 4 didn&#039;t drop (it even increased, the 32 GB model including 2 year telecom-services: T-Mobile now to €329 + €29,95 a month, was €269 + €29,95 a month when introduced).Maybe I will buy the new iPad 2 instead of the iPhone 4 or even wait for the iPhone 5.Picture and movie editing, visual and speech-recognition, streaming camera recording, stereo-audio recording and a longer battery-life (currently max. 8 hours continuous use) is what I&#039;m aiming for.Below my initial comments - in concept - of June 30, 2010:Yes I will also comment about the new Apple iPhone 4. The long awaited new iPhone after the iPhone 3GS was announced just over one month ago and sales skyrocketed in the first days to almost 2 million pieces with the pre-orders.OK I admit it: I really want one. But why? Mainly for the features I miss on my current iPhone 3G: Good quality pictures, videorecording + editing, multitasking, a compass (which was already included in the 3GS) and Blue-tooth Keyboard support.I wonder how many people actually use these specific features, but we will find out soon:Given the new video + editing possibilities on the iPhone 4, this should increase video-blogging: This feature will definitely increase the number of movies on YouTube.com (Although movies and clips can be recorded in HD(ready) quality it gives no guarantee about the value of the published content.Quality pictures: pictures taken at workshops or seminars currently (with 3G) are often not acceptable enough for archive-use. The new 5 MP (low light support) camera will probably produce better quality pictures. I assume with multi-tasking background support there will be note-taking apps like Evernote that support recording, scribble note-taking and taking pictures at the same time (without interruption of the stereo(?) recording).Multi-tasking: for what I have come to hear it&#039;s a low level multitasking-feature like music or streaming background sound but it&#039;s a good start. Background recording or better live Speech-recognition with Dragon Dictate (not yet available in EU) or Dragon Naturally Speaking on my iPhone would be nice.Live sound analysis like Shazam or SoundHound now does for music with (con)textual information and recognition with GPS combined with personal preferences could be a new killer app. A location based genius-like app for suggested places to go to, attractions to visit and people to meet (a bit like aka-aki, but with live location-based feeds: sort of a &quot;around me&quot;+ app)'>Omnigadgets iPhone 4 - iPhone 5 - iPad 2</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metamagazine.blogspot.com/2010/05/trend-fusion-artist-lady-gaga.html' title='At first I must have ignored Lady Gaga&#039;s popularity as an artist until it became obvious a few months ago she&#039;s one of the most influencial people in performance, music and fashion at the moment (even to the world according to Time May 2010 Time 100). At the moment many fans and artists use Lady Gaga as inspiration for creating their own style. For example: Lady Gaga combines several (known) styles in her performance art video&#039;s and clips: she dresses extravagant, sexy, uses all kinds of fashion accessories, Bling-bling (diamonds and sparkling jewelery), extreme makeup, masks, Gothic subculture, spiritual symbols, new wave, avant-garde and Electropop. On sites about Lady Gaga it is said she&#039;s influenced by Marc Bolan, David Bowie (both artist in the Glam Rock genre), also Queen, Madonna and Michael Jackson are mentioned as wel as Deepak Chopra in het Times interview, her dress-style is a tribute to Andy Warhol known from his pop-art.OK this was only my introduction to my point: Lady Gaga to me is an example of an even bigger Fusion-trend in music and fashion using popular items and concepts from the past. The fact Lady Gaga is the most downloaded artist on YouTube (almost 213,000,000 times at the moment for the Bad Romance Video). This specific Lady Gaga video has some common elements with the classic 1982 Thriller videoclip by Michael jackson (13.42 min.); the supernatural, zombie-like creatures, the crawling dance, the world in a world, and struggle for power.The interesting part about the designs is the link to cultural, cult and fashion-trends. It&#039;s very loose and therefore adaptive, which means anybody can join in and reuse the ideas to their own like. Lady Gaga created a movement, a tribal sphere of creatives who are inspired to create their own style. She&#039;s a catalist for style innovation and that&#039;s why she&#039;s setting a trend.Update June 10:I just watched the new Alejandro video (Also see YouTube) via the official Lady Gaga website. Well produced but maybe a bit too much erotic and less Gaga style what we know her for. Some interesting new dance-moves to say the least. The eroticism might just be interpreted as a selling tool like Madonna once did but with the difference that it had been done before: is she going for easy publicity? Sure sex sells but is she going mainstream and follow Madonna&#039;s path (Gaga even uses similar religious symbols)  now that we can see her real face in the video? Is she testing her public? Suggestions and rumors about Lady Gaga posing nude for Playboy are getting heavier and Gaga seems to explore this medium as a way of expression. Below the quotes from Popcrunch.com:“No-one wants her to do it. Her business people are trying to  convince her that it could be seen as being a bit lowbrow and cheesy,  and will alienate her fans who like her edgy appeal,” says a spying  Bunny close to the rumored Playboy deal. “She thinks it will be an  experience, and she’s always looking to grow as an artist. She doesn’t  think there’s anything distasteful about it. She sees it as just another  form of expression.”The source squeals: “She’s been  chatting with everyone about it all week. She’s always been a fan of  Hugh Hefner’s, and his whole sex-as-art kind of thing. She’s always  looking to shock and entertain, and something like this would be perfect  for her. She wants her shoot to be like nothing Playboy has every seen  before. If she doesn’t drop it, her nude shoot will be like nothing  Playboy has ever seen!”We shouldn&#039;t forget Lady Gaga is an artist trying to explore (and maybe exploit) every medium and channel to the fullest. The challenge is to continue and top the teasing-climax after publication. What is the next level after full exposure? What if Gaga&#039;s erotic videoclips are reduced (in the public minds eye) to a teaser for her posing nude for Playboy? Can she continue to make other (new) forms of visual satisfaction? What new performance dimensions will she explore or develop? Will her &quot;little monsters&quot; (as she calls her fans) stand by her and support her in her exploration at the edge, in nudity expression? Does she dissociate from her fans and cross a point of no return? She is playing with fire since the public expects something extraordinary; an ordinary nude beach-shoot for Lady Gaga would probably be considered artistic suicide.I sincerely hope Lady Gaga will continue to explore her creative expression as an artist and not reduce herself to just another Playmate or Playboy-Bunny.[Will probably be continued]'>Trend Fusion Artist Lady Gaga</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metamagazine.blogspot.com/2010/03/life-is-game-and-rules-are-changing.html' title='What if you could consider your Life as a Game?What would be the Rules (general principals,  norms &amp; moral guidelines) and Goal of the game?What kind of incentive and punishment are you giving yourself (You, the Player)?What activities, interactions and accomplishments would you earn &#039;points&#039; for?What kind of points would you like to score?Would you go for accumulation of Wealth (currently measured in a relative subjective form of Currency: Money) or maybe another value good like: Gold, Clean Water or Energy-units?Also directly related: What kind of Bad (like waste and garbage) should you avoid or deal with?On a more Psychological and Spiritual ground you could deal with- or eliminate &#039;mind&#039;-things that are taking a lot of your time, like worries or unnecessary energy-leaks (resulting in stress): Humans tend to have energy-leaks towards the past or the future. These (often recurring) thoughts about certain people or events are an indication (and opportunity of awareness) that you are not being fully present in the now. You need to accept and forgive to give closure to these (often negative) energy-absorbing thoughts. For the future it is best to be positive (or at least neutral) toward anticipated events. If you sense fear in yourself, you can accept this fear as a signal that you need to prepare or even practice for the anticipated event, like a Fire-drill. As an alternative visualization exercise: If you can accept the worst-case scenario as a possibility you will feel relieved. A generic attitude (by default) with focus on a smooth and positive outcome is best for your body&#039;s energy-system and for your health. The stress-level can physically be measured as Heart Coherence (measuring the HRV: Heart Rhythm Variable) with a sensor attached to your finger or ear. This stress-variable can be measured with a portable device and added to your current Life-game.[Related Biofeedback: Heartmath emWave, Game: The Wild Divine]The interesting (self-reflecting) factor in your Life as a Game begins when you start thinking about your passions, the things you really like to do (normally: things that give you energy), your natural skills, and your success-variables.[Changing Rules]The New Economy, and life within this economy has new rules. The new consumers label themselves as Fans (Apple inc.) vs Customers (Microsoft) which adds a new dimension to Brands. People tend to be loyal to their personality patterns, or put differently: &quot;people don&#039;t like to change their common behavior&quot;. Brand loyalty can be measured in real life (a tendency to buy one product over the other: ceteris paribus) but in a game-setting these Brand aspects might be described in product-context terms like &quot;Popularity&quot; (based on current sales), or product Quality terms &quot;component or ingredient declaration and Quality&quot; (which is most frequently used), &quot;Industry Standard&quot;, &quot;Connectivity &amp; Usability&quot;, &quot;Open vs Closed Source&quot;, and the Cradle to Cradle (C2C) &quot;Product Lifespan &amp; Lifecycle&quot;. I would not be surprised if sustainability and social accountability (like ecological fair trade &amp; treatment of employees) as a Brand value become more important. As an example: the iPhone application (Goodguide.com) scans and checks barcodes with databases revealing the context and lifecycle aspects of the product and Brand. This way you are able to score all aspects of a product (energetic, ecological, ethical, political and sustainable). For example if you want specific info about your ecological footprint you can add these values to your Life-game and make a purchase choice on a product-level.Web 2.0 (inter-connectivity (RSS), personalized pages, communities) and Web 3.0 (mobile contextual info, meta-tags, and P2P tribes) changes the way we communicate and interact with others. You can see online companies adding interactivity to their communication with terms like dialog-marketing sending personalized mail (harvested by a contest, web-form or social networks). Amazon&#039;s personalized and customized recommendations based on previous orders and similarities with other customers in the data-pool are probably the best example.Given the fact we can communicate and interact relatively easy worldwide with other people on the Internet, a personal challenge with the right social networking coordination can immediately become a collaborative project, multipliable initiative or even a tribal movement. The implications of unlimited scalability through the available technology are enormous and we can only grasp the near future. The power and possibilities of Crowdsourcing, Crowdfunding, tribes, social networks (which are now very measurable) and mobile technology will definitely change our world-view and the way we live. I hope we will create some real life contexts (domains / arena&#039;s) to play with this technology in sandboxes before all newbies and digitally impaired are broadcasting everywhere and (unintended) clogging or even destroy (by overloading) the system. Peer review (like on Wikipedia) might offer a solution, but I seriously see a need for Computer, Media and Internet (Communication Technology) education (Information Literacy)  in non-invasive, limited impact controlled sandbox context.Back to your Life-Game, some final thoughts:What is your preferred Arena (playing field)?What are your specific targets (within this context or arena)?What resources will you use? (information, tools, materials, people, funding)When have you reached your &quot;level&quot;?How will you be awarded and how will you share your experience and accomplishments?How can you document and model your accomplishments as a teaching for others?Other related info: Game Theory, Moral Psychology, WikiHow: Make-Your-Life-a-Roleplaying-Game, Goalsetting community: 43 Things]'>Life is a Game; and the rules are changing</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metamagazine.blogspot.com/2010/01/development-of-iphone-aplication-xs.html' title='Project Proposal: Accessibility Explorer or XS Explorer       Accessible Europe is a project of Toegankelijk Nederland.nl – draft 1.3SummaryIn order to collect user generated accessibility data about locations (buildings and travel destinations) and use the great potential of a potentially worldwide user database. I propose an iPhone application named Accessibility Explorer or XS Explorer (as a shortened name). With the Apple iPhone you can survey and take pictures of the location directly from inside the XS Explorer application and use it to visualize specific attention area’s. The iPhone touch screen can also be used to draw a sketch of a room or situation and you could link it as comment to a question. You can even record audio comments making this useful as a real reviewing tool. The build in GPS-receiver will be used to place the location on maps and link it to pda, mobile phones (smartphones) and other navigation devices through Points Of Interest (POI’s). About Accessible EuropeAccessible Europe’s mission is to chart the accessibility and usability of public buildings, attractions and travel destinations. The primary focus is on people with specific disability challenges like being unable to walk (and therefore use a wheelchair), being unable to see (blind or short-sighted using tools to navigate and distinguish visual information), difficulty with hearing (using special hearing devices or totally deaf, meaning alternative means of communication other than audio or voice. Other specific challenges needed adaptations or requirements in buildings are asthma (COPD), obesity, baby-care and being short. Accessible Europe collects and shares location based accessibility information about available public facilities (for specific disabilities) in and around buildings (objects) like restaurants, libraries, hotels and museums.ExampleIf you’re planning a family reunion in a group facility it is vitally important to know beforehand if your aunt in a wheelchair can sit at the dining room table and if there is a wheelchair toilet where she can go to powder her nose. If the meetingroom is on the second floor you also need to know if there is an elevator and if the doors of the elevator are big enough for a standard-size or XL-sized wheelchair. Become an Accessibility ExplorerWith the proposed multilingual iPhone application all iPhone users can become instant Accessibility Explorers or XS Explorers. The idea is adding new objects on the go. Any (public) building or destination you visit can be added. Keep in mind we&#039;re looking for accessible locations. After registration (with username, password and email with confirmation) as an Accessibility Explorer you can use the Accessibility Explorer tool (or XS Explorer for short)Steps: 1.    Stand before the main entrance of the object/location. Press “Add new object”, the current GPS location will be stored while typing in the name of the object. Select the function of the object from the rollbar: (for example Restaurant, Cinema, Public Toilet, Hotel, Retailstore)2.    When the name and function are saved, the online database is checked if this location (300 meters) or if this name already exists in the database. If location and/or name exists you will be presented with the option to review and/or edit the existing data or add a new object. Used Object-ID&#039;s will be stored on the iPhone. Active Explorers will be reminded to review and comment visited locations / objects. 3.    Add general contact info or URL for the object (usually found on folders, brochures, businesscards found at the entrance or reception). 4.    Take a picture of the main-entrance or front of the object. (picture is automatically uploaded in background, after being resized to max. 1024 pixels if needed) Select the categories-types (logo’s) you want to review or chart (default = all); Wheelchair toilet, Wheelchair, Deaf (or bad hearing), Blind (visually impaired), Asthma (COPD), Obesity (extreme overweight), and baby-care (lactation-room and/or diaper changing facility).5.    Fill in the category questions with a score +, +/-, -, unknown (default), not applicable. comment each question if needed. These scoring is based on the ITC (International Accessibility Codes which are in the contextual help on screen with examples to determine the score. Exact measurements (with / length / height in cm) (of doorways or elevators for example) can also be added if the Accessibility Explorer has a measuring-tool available for this.6.    Take pictures or draw a sketch at each critical point (entrance, corridor, leverage angle, turning circles, etc.). Registered XS Explorers also have the ability to draw or sketch on top of a new or existing picture. The original pictures are stored in the archive.7.    Fill in extra info at the notes section. Save all object info on the iPhone.8.    Review the explored object and upload it to the server. (upload with pictures can also be done later when in WiFi-range). Personal comments and notes can be added to each of the questions, categories or rooms.9.    Registered Accesibility Explorers could receive Explorer community points for each object they successfully upload. (The system keeps track of all submitted locations and feedback on the information-quality)After internal checking of the submitted data the owner from the object will receive an automatic message: Hi, Your location &quot;[Location name]&quot; classified as &quot;[object function]&quot; on GPS mapped location [GPS object location] was visited by an Accessibility Explorer [XS Explorer Nickname] on [object visit date].Please review the data online [XSexplorer object URL/Object ID]If you feel this information is incorrect or incomplete, please register as Accessibility Explorer and edit the object.You can also change or add more contact information, your opening hours and a description of 2000 characters.If you score at least one + in the XS Explorer review you may add our &quot;Visited by Accessibility Explorer&quot; Logo and link to your homepage. If a visitor clicks the logo he will go to the review of your location on our webpage. You can choose copy and paste the code or banner from the MyXSexplorer page.If you want more information on how to make your location more accessible please visit [Accessibility Explorer building tips URL]Thanks for your support,The XS Explorer team.Find accessible object1. press &quot;search from current location&quot; to check for objects nearby (scalable in &quot;Settings&quot; from 1 km to 50km radius). All accessibility options are selected by default but can be unclicked. The results in unchecked categories will be grey and nearest results with checked criteria with show first. Options to search for object type, name, city, province or radius from current position.2. Select your location to display Accessibility info and contact info.3. Click call [name location] to call the specific location.4. Click Show on map to show the location in the maps application5. Click Navigate to location to start your navigation application Extra software features:·    Accessibility Warnings: A dangerous or critical notification about an object / location. (like Wikango speedcamera warnings app)·    For larger outdoor objects like theme-parks you can add sub-objects like wheelchair-toilets and continue from step 4 with a new picture. Database entries:XS explorer username, object GPS location(s), object name, object function, date and time of initial data collection, date and time of submission (or mutation) [also: keep mutation history], contact information Location question categories: accessibility streetwalk path (bestrating), entrance, entry level (begane grond), elevator, toilet, wheelchair toilet, bathroom, corridor, primary room, hearing , blind / sighted, obesity and baby care questions. Applications for other mobile platforms like Windows Mobile, Blackberry and Google Android should be added as soon as the basic iPhone app is running. The accessibility database website should have a mobile / pda-version for viewing on a small screen. Primary connections to Google-maps and augmented reality applications like Layar should be implemented from the start. Being an XS Explorer using Interactive augmented reality while answering questions about the object could a cutting edge application and fun thing to do. This could give the Accessibility Database a real boost. HistoryToegankelijkNederland started in 2001 with zipcode based location information using a paper questionnaire; the answers were transcribed on the input webpages connecting and storing it to the central database. The current database was setup with the presentation in mind and is not ideal for collection of GPS based object-data.GPSA few years ago pda’s and smartphones became more and more advanced with build-in camera’s and GPS. XS Explorer collects and charts location based information with GPS. GPS-info is used by mapping and navigation devices. For exchange and connectivity between systems it is more logical to use GPS as a general identifier than zipcodes. It is still highly recommended to also collect the formal address and object information like name and contactinfo (such as telephonenumber, email and URL). The iPhone app is focused on easy data collection and location based retrieval.Costs &amp; InvestmentThe initial XS Explorer application for charting Accessibility should be free from the Apple App store to promote the XS Explorers community. Advertising from featured Accessible locations could pay for the community. Integration with other applications or adding other personal location based info could be sold as a paid iPhone application XS Explorer Pro. Spin-offs or combinations with desktop-syncing applications like Evernote are ways to monetize this app. This app can easily be modified and used for adding meta-info about any GPS-location (like an external addon for MotionX GPS) or object and any questions can be added.Option 1: Low Budget: An initial investment with a programmer-auction site like Elance.com or rentacoder.com could be around EUR 3500 for the app, database and basic CMS with a monthly cost for hosting and maintenance of around EUR 200. Option 2: Adaptation or sponsoring by a software-development company showing high valued real useful application of their technology. This is a win-win situation since the company created a new service for a potential group of 15-35% of all people who use one or more accessibility tags for objects. A wheelchair accessibility tag usually means strollers with babies or small children will most likely also fit. The only condition for sponsoring or Joint Venture is that usage of the accessibility-database is non-exclusive and should be open to anyone. (Also for other application builders).A new database and community website should be developed for this Accessibility Explorer application. An API for search, import / export and object-mutation requests could be made to facilitate synchronisation and connections between other databases and applications. ContextAccessibleEurope (ToegankelijkNederland.NL) is currently (December 2009) in the final phase of testing a new accessibility website made in the CMS Joomla. Instructed volunteers from the different disability-organisations will visit specific object locations (like restaurants, hotels, public service buildings and theatres). These volunteers will measure and test accessibility and usability by answering a basic set of questions for their specific disability in all (or most crucial) functions (and/or room-types) in an object. Data exampleNormal wheelchair accessibility for example requires a minimum passage with of 80cm including enough space for a a turning circle of the wheelchair; this is scored as +/-. For an extra large wheelchair you should have a minimum of 100cm and a larger turning circle; these entries and passages are scored +. Examples of other measured aspects are height-differences (should be minimal), toilets, (bathrooms / showers), elevators (is it big enough and can it be operated from within the wheelchair?), reception or service-desks (can it be used from within the wheelchair?), lockers (within reach), usable table height, and available exits. I need help setting this up. If you have experience with building iPhone apps or like this project please contact me for more info.

Very useful for the 4D NLP base-model (Current Situation, Wanted (changed) situation, Blocks and Resources) checking for congruence, future pace and especially realistic / SMART goalsetting. Question for Ask the Coach:Change is hard. It takes forever and I don&#039;t even know if it&#039;s working. Any tips for making this process easier? Change takes longer than we think and the process is difficult. Acknowledging these facts can make your attempts more successful. My co-author Dr. Kelly Goldsmith, Assistant Professor of Marketing at Northwestern&#039;s Kellogg School of Management, and I researched why people give up on their goals. We discovered that there are five common reasons. Understanding these roadblocks will help you apply some preventive medicine — and increase the odds that you won&#039;t fall into the same old traps.1. Ownership&quot;I wasn&#039;t sure that this would work in the first place. I tried it out — it didn&#039;t do that much good. As I guessed, this was kind of a waste of time.&quot;The classic mistake made in leadership development, coaching, and self-help books is the promise that &quot;This will make you better!&quot; After years of experience in helping real leaders change real behavior in the real world, I have learned a hard lesson. Only you will make you better. To have a real chance of success, you have to take personal ownership and have the internal belief that &quot;This will work if, and only if, I make it work. I am going to make this work.&quot;2. Time&quot;I had no idea that this process would take so long. I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s worth it.&quot;Goal setters have a chronic tendency to underestimate the time needed to reach targets. In setting our goals for behavioral change, it&#039;s important to be realistic about the time we need to produce positive, lasting results. Habits that have taken years to develop won&#039;t go away in a week. Set time expectations that are 50% to 100% longer than you think you will need to see results — then add a little more.3. Difficulty&quot;This is a lot harder than I thought it would be. It sounded so simple when we were starting out.&quot;The optimism bias of goal setters applies to difficulty as well as time. Not only does everything take longer than we think it will, but it also requires more hard work than we anticipate. In setting goals, it&#039;s important to accept the fact that real change requires real work. Acknowledging the price for success in the beginning of the change process will help prevent the disappointment that can occur when challenges arise later.4. Distractions&quot;I would really like to work toward my goal, but I&#039;m facing some unique challenges right now. It might be better if I just stopped and did this at a time when things weren&#039;t so crazy.&quot;Goal setters have a tendency to underestimate the distractions and competing goals that will invariably appear throughout the year. A piece of advice that I give all of my coaching clients is: &quot;I&#039;m not sure what crisis will appear, but I&#039;m almost positive that some crisis will appear.&quot; Plan for distractions in advance. Assume that crazy is the new normal. You will probably be close to the reality that awaits.5. Maintenance&quot;I think that I did actually try to change and get better, but I have let it slide since then. What am I supposed to do — work on this stuff the rest of my life?&quot;Once a goal setter has put in all of the effort needed to achieve a goal, it can be tough for him to face the reality of what&#039;s needed to maintain the new status quo. When one of my high-potential leaders asked his boss, the CEO, &quot;Do I have to watch what I say and do for the rest of my career?&quot; the CEO replied, &quot;You do if you plan on ever becoming a CEO!&quot; Here are the cold, hard truths. Real change requires real effort. The &quot;quick fix&quot; is seldom a meaningful one. Distractions and things that compete for your attention are going to crop up — frequently. Changing any one type of behavior won&#039;t solve all of life&#039;s problems. And finally, any meaningful change will probably require a lifetime of effort.[The original Ask The Coach article &#039;Don&#039;t Give Up on Change&#039; by Marshall Goldsmith was copied from: Harvard Business.org]'>Identify Roadblocks - Don&#039;t Give Up on Change</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metamagazine.blogspot.com/2009/09/47-ways-to-fine-tune-your-brain.html' title='47 Ways to Fine Tune Your Brain (by Steven Aitchison)Your brain is a complex organ.  It is the controller of your body, your thoughts, your state of mind and your ultimately your life. There are some who abuse it, some who underuse it, and some who overuse it to the point of meltdown.In this article we&#039;ll look at dozens of  tactics that will help you maintain your brain into old age and help to increase your mental agility and cognitive development.Don&#039;t try and multitask, it can&#039;t be done.Our brains can only focus and concentrate on one thing at a time, this is a proven scientific fact. While you can most likely handle multiple menial tasks, anything that requires you to concentrate, reason, or decide deserves full focus. Exercise your brain, not just your body.A lot of us leave learning behind when we leave school, college or university. Keep the brain fit by learning something new, whether it be a language, a new skill or musical instrument.The world is a mystery. Use your brain to constantly ask questions and explore your surroundings. Continually exercise your brain by not accepting everything you see and hear: question it and free your sense of curiosity.Use both hemispheresUse the left hemisphere of your brain to practice logical, mathematical problems in your life. Use the right hemisphere to unleash your creativity. You will know what side is dominant so make it a point to practice using your non dominant hemisphere.Get to know your sleeping pattern. Your brain needs sleep as much as your body but everybody is different. I function on 5-6 hours you might work best on 8-9 hours.Feed your brain decent information. Your brain is learning throughout the night, so give it something worthwhile to feed it. Our brain is not restoring energy whilst we are sleeping it is cutting out the noise and going over the days events and processing it; give it some great material to process. If you want to learn more whilst studying, start pacing. If you are reading a book, start pacing. Movement gets the blood flowing and this helps oxygenate your brain. I walked my way through university and have taught my sons study walking to help them memorize information.You&#039;ve heard it before.Exercise is probably the number 1 way to increase the brains capabilities in every way possible, from memory to creativity. There&#039;s no getting around it, we all need to exercise.Keep SocialStaying socially active has been shown to keep your brain sharp well into old age. Use the internet to keep your brain active. A University of California Los Angeles team found searching the web stimulated centers in the brain that controlled decision-making and complex reasoning. Eat dark chocolate. Yes, eating dark chocolate has been shown to be beneficial for releasing an important brain chemical called dopamine. Dopamine aids in learning and memory.Learn a song. Learn the lyrics of some of your favorite songs to keep your listening skills and memory skills alive. Watch brain stimulating movies. Movies that make you think (such as mysteries) help keep your brain and mind active.Play video gamesThis has been shown to increase cognitive abilities and can help fight Alzheimer&#039;s. Practice doing things with your non-dominant hand.This stimulates the brain in many areas and also can be quite fun. Use meditation as a way to alleviate your stress. There are thousands of studies about the beneficial effects of mediation and keeping your stress levels down is good for you. You lose brain cells the more stressed you feel, so controlling stress levels is important. Laugh as often as possible. Laughing out loud boosts the immune system and releases endorphins, the bodies feel good chemicals.Think positive. Thinking positively is a great way to keep your brain alive. Constant negative thinking depresses the mind and goes on to literally depress the immune system. Thinking more positive thoughts is a good way to keep stress down and spur you to take action for a better life.Practice gratitude. Practicing gratitude can increase your happiness level significantly which helps to alleviate stress which helps your whole brain and body.SexSex is another great way to keep your cardiovascular system healthy which means more oxygen to your brain which keeps the brain healthy.Read a great book.No matter what type of books you read, they are all beneficial in keeping your brain healthy and active and ward off the aging process. Drink less alcohol.Alcohol in moderation can actually be good for the brain, however too much alcohol can kill brain cells and your ability to be able to think and reason effectively.Working.A lot of people look forward to giving up work as we get older, however, working even in a part time job can keep the mind active. If you are retired you can do volunteer work to keep you active. Keep up to date with current events and news.Keeping your brain fit is about feeding your mind with new information. Watching current affairs programs can help with this so long as they don&#039;t stress you out. Listen to music.Listening to music that you wouldn&#039;t normally listen to is another good way to keep your brain active. Music has the ability to release positive emotions in you.Dance.Dancing is a great all around for both mind and body. Learning s a new dance helps your cognitive skills, your spatial awareness, your social skills, your motor skills and helps keeps your body healthy.Throw a ball.Throwing and catching a ball is great for sensory-guided movement. It can improve your brain’s visual, tactile and hand-eye coordination responses and keep them sharp well into old age. Eat well.Eating certain types of food can really be beneficial to your brains chemistry. Avoid fatty foods and eat more vegetables and fruit. This is sound advice for brain and body. Drink plenty of water.Drinking water helps the cells function properly and keeps you feeling hydrated from the inside out.Have a cup of tea.Drinking tea, hot or cold, can stimulate your brain in many ways. Tea contains caffeine which can be good for you if drunk in moderation. Take a trip.Have you always fancies traveling well it has been shown that traveling really does broaden your horizons. Use your debating skills.Having friendly debates with friends and family can improve your logical, thinking, reasoning and creativity skills. Sleep a little longer.Sleeping an extra few hours every now and again is good for rejuvenating your brain and help you learn faster.Take naps.Taking a nap throughout the day can help keep you from feeling tired and help stave off &#039;brain fog&#039;. A ten minute nap will do to help you function throughout the day.Turn down the TV.If you watch a lot of TV turn it down to hone your listening and concentration skills.Break the cycle.If you tend to do the same thing day in day out, try and break the pattern of your activities. Your brain relies on doing something different to keep it active, break your normal routine to do this. Learn a new word. Learning anything new will help keep your brain healthy. Learning a new word each day is a simple way to accomplish this.Look at old photographs.This is a great way to keep your memories alive and to strengthen cell connections within the brain.Do something outrageous.Doing things we would normally never do like a bungee jump, a parachute jump, hill climbing, a helicopter ride, etc.,  will keep your brain alive, literally. Train your brain.The &#039;cogni-fit&#039; industry is huge and is growing every year and for good reason. Start playing some of these &#039;cogni-fit&#039; games to keep your brain healthy and active.Take supplements.Supplements like omega-3, folic acid with vitamin B-12, CoEnzyme Q10, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, and an all round strong multi-vitamin supplement, has been shown to slow down the aging process. Check with your doctor before taking supplements.Mindfulness. A simple mindfulness exercise is to just sit and relax and pay attention to your breathing. This helps to promote relaxation, keep your mind focused, helps with concentration and does the body a world of good. Develop critical thinking skills.Critical thinking involves you asking questions of yourself and the world around and looking for evidence of your assumptions.Become a philosopher.Not literally, but start thinking about the bigger questions in life. This develops your brain on many levels. More than likely you will never come up with a definitive answer to the big questions but it keeps your brain and mind active.Make your own affirmations.Affirmations are a great way to keep your mind focused on your life goals. When you use affirmations you are also using your imagination, and activating other regions in your brain which can help with memory, creativity and even releasing feel good chemicals. Thinking outside the box.I always thought this was a strange saying as you cannot really think outside the box when you are always living inside the box of knowledge. However over the years I have come to realize it really means thinking without using your reasoning skills to look for alternatives and it can be a great way to keep your mind active.Sing out loud.Singing is a great way to help you focus and get rid of stress. People who sing out loud feel happier as they are not internalizing thoughts but focusing on an ext renal action, their voice. It also aids memory.Scientists now know that our brains continuously make new neurons throughout our lives and it does this in response to the what we do in our lives. Neurons are important for transmitting and making connections with other cells. If we lose the neurons, we lose the power to think properly, to use our creativity, to learn, to memorize effectively, basically our brains slowly die. Exercise and brain stimulation is one of the best ways to keep making these new neurons. Using some of the examples above you will keep your brain healthy and active for years to come.[This Article was copied from another Blog:  Dumblittleman.com]'>47 Ways to Fine Tune Your Brain</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metamagazine.blogspot.com/2009/09/online-sources-for-geeks-infoworkers.html' title='In the past I may have resented the term &#039;Geek&#039;, but since it has become more mainstream I find myself using resources targeted at Geeks and informationworkers.Here they are:Geekbrief.tv - Shiny Happy Tech News.

Internet &amp; iPhone  There is no Internet-connection here so I used my iPhone for checking my mail once a day for urgent messages. The mobile phone and dataconnection on the Telia DK telephone network is expensive (€ 2 / MB) so I had my iPhone in flightmode most of the time. Unfortunately, almost all but a few iPhone apps (38 items) need to be upgraded for OS3 and this needs to be downloaded. Some apps require a fast WiFi connection and iTunes connected to the Internet. I tried to download and upgrade apps when I found an open WiFi network in a shopping street in Fredericia. Since my wife and kids were walking ahead I finally had to catch up and loose the connection (I could upgrade 3 non-essential apps). A Danish student told me most McDonalds supposedly have WiFi hotspots but the two restaurants I visited had none.  Maybe If I really set my mind to it I would have been able to localize an open wifi network but I choose not to. No Twitter, no news, no downloads, no TV (there were 3 Danish free to Air channels). I did not even miss Twitter, even though I still get followers (Why if I’m not posting twits at all?)   As a precaution I was advised not to use Twitter during my vacation since this could alert unwanted visitors. Does anybody have experience with this?     Cultural impressions  We drove by large parts of the famous Marguerite route in Danmark which gives a good impression of the beautiful Danish scenery (just follow the flower on the boards).  We visited Legoland Billund two days which was fun for the kids. I had a personal record of  waiting 40 minutes in line for hotdogs. Fransk hotdogs seem to be the favourite fastfood snack here (being a round bread with a hole in it for the sauce and hotdog. (Traditional hotdogs are &#039;risted&#039; with dry baked onions). Also we had our first lakritz (licorice / drop) salty icecream, probably a variation of the famous Smorredrop. The Danish bread and sweet bakery products are really a specialty. Every supermarket and most gasstations have a large selection of freshly baked Danish products. We have seen second hand shops in almost every town or city we visited. Sales of used products seems to be more common in Danmark than in the Netherlands given the many second-hand shops and flea markets we have seen. We visited Kolding on several days with its large swimming &amp; wellness center. The last thursday we went to the Legepark in Kolding with the kids. This park is build and run by unemployed (according to the brochure) and is free to visit. There is a large playground with moonbikes, a pond with rowingboats and waterbikes. We played minigolf and my daughter wanted to play chess with large pieces (I need to teach her the rules of the game first). I highly recommend the Kolding Legepark if you want a relaxed afternoon with your kids. Earlier this week we had a tour to Ribe, climbed the stairs of the Church to the top. Esbjerg city center and Harbour. We went to Haderslev, Fredericia with a waterstream running through the streets, Vejle, Odense with the large railway museum and Fyns Hoved (the top of the island) with the beautiful scenery and many Rocks.On our way home we visited Tonder where they just had a cultural festival where people were dressed up for in antique clothing. We made a carriage horse-ride with our family. We waited 3 hours at the Elbefahre (boat) but we had a good vacation in Danmark.

We (Martien Faber, Yarick Westein en ik, Toine Fennis) zijn in 2012 gestart met de website http://www.helendeherberg.nl Het idee was het aanbieden van een training of cursus genaamd De Energetische Gereedschapskist (Energy Toolbox). De 4 peilers of pilaren van De Helende Herberg zijn: Ontmoeting (verbinding), Healing (genezing), Inspiratie (educatie &amp; kennisdeling) en Verblijf (gastvrijheid, verblijf-ruimten, slaapplaats, overnachting).Bij het brainstormen werd het een wereldwijd netwerk: The Healing Lodge Alliance  (zie Mindmap):Het uitwerken van de cursus kostte meer tijd dan we dachten waardoor het Helende Herberg als concept ook vertraagde. Daarnaast waren er ook issues met het duiden van context-informatie als gezondheidsclaims met betrekking tot natuurlijke en geneeskundige producten. In een onderzoekende of educatieve context mag trouwens alle informatie (op dit moment) wel gedeeld worden.Het idee is snel een membership-site (met meerdere lidmaatschaps-vormen) op te zetten zodat mensen deel kunnen nemen aan het netwerk. Door je in te schrijven kun je een profielpagina aanmaken waardoor je met andere leden in contact kunt komen op basis van doelen, vraag, aanbod, vaardigheden, interesse, etc.Ook de mogelijkheid om zelf meetings te organiseren zou een enorme boost kunnen geven.De instap voor verblijf vanaf couch-surfing level bied voor iedereen de mogelijkheid om mee te doen als gastvrouw / gastheer of als gast.Het uitwerken van het waarde- en verdien-model en de marketing zal nog moeten gebeuren. Door betaling in tijd toe te staan (uitwerking Time Payment Provider &amp; Timebank) zou iedereen deel moeten kunnen nemen aan het netwerk. Geen geld hebben mag geen reden zijn om niet deel te nemen. Geen tijd maar wel geld zou misschien ook een reden kunnen zijn een aantal werkzaamheden, taken of klussen binnen het Helende Herberg Netwerk uit te besteden.Via de grootste microkluswebsite Fiverr.com heb ik een logo laten maken:en Het zit in de buurt maar is het nog net niet dus ik heb nog 2 opdrachten geplaatst. ben erg benieuwd wat daaruit komt.

Los van de controle mindset, hoe ik me voel: van overweldigend (1) tot het gevoel van alles onder controle te hebben (10). (=kwantificeerbare schaalindeling)Dit stuk is voor mijzelf conceptualiserend &amp; probleemverkennendDe gefragmenteerde informatie via zovele bronnen: social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), kranten, TV, radio, en persoonlijke + telefoongesprekken die daar weer naar verwijzen. Het is vergelijkbaar met de information overload waar we met de opkomst van Internet halverwege de jaren &#039;90 opnieuw voor werden gewaarschuwd. Het gevaar is niet zozeer de overload als wel de information pollution :Informatie vervuiling: de verontreiniging (besmetting) van informatievoorziening (stromen en media) met irrelevante, overbodige, ongevraagde en laagwaardige informatie. De verspreiding van nutteloze en ongewenste informatie kan een nadelig effect op de menselijke activiteiten hebben. Het wordt beschouwd als een van de nadelige gevolgen van de informatierevolutie.Er kan vanuit de informatieleer een hiërarchie aangegeven worden om onderscheid te maken tussen gegevens (data), informatie, kennis en wijsheid. De gegevens (data) zijn sensaties, feiten, cijfers, enz., die onafhankelijk en atomair van aard zijn. Informatie kan worden omschreven als georganiseerde data, de patronen die in de gegevens bestaan​​, of de onderliggende betekenis van samenhangende stukken data. Kennis is het vermogen om informatie te begrijpen en te gebruiken. Wijsheid is het vermogen om op de beste manier gebruik te maken van kennis. Het gebrek aan kwalitatief hoogwaardige informatie is een deel van het probleem, maar ook alles waardoor aandacht van lezer, luisteraar of kijker (de ontvanger van de boodschap) wordt afgeleid van de essentie (of de informatieverwerkende taak) verontreinigt de ontvangen en te verwerken informatie.Spam (ongevraagde reclame) verpakt in de vorm van belangrijk lijkende email, en interstitials (verplichte, niet te skippen banners of reclame tussen webpagina&#039;s of filmpjes) irriteren mij persoonlijk het meest.Er zijn meerdere informatie vervuilende krachten actief op Internet: social media die content reduceren tot visuele appetizers (waar zijn de hapklare brokken gebleven?), die als maaltijd met je netwerk gedeeld en becommentarieerd worden, en het al dan niet geautomatiseerde content-spinning van informatie-producten (alsof je oude lektuur in een mixer gooit en het resultaat opnieuw als origineel werk uitgeeft).Omdat Google tekstueel redundante content bestraft met een lagere ranking worden behalve goede teksten ook slechte teksten gehusseld zodat het uniek lijkt. De automatische vertalingen en vertalen naar een andere taal en terugvertalen is zo&#039;n trucje wat de content meestal niet ten goede komt.In mijn boek De Bias (The Bias) zal ik hier ook verder op ingaan.'>Informatie fragmentatie</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metaq.blogspot.com/2013/02/ideeen-over-geldsystemen.html' title='Fragmenten van mijn tekst uit de dialoog op Mindz.com van Toine Fennis en Georges Platt over Geldsystemen Wat is GeldGeld is alles wat algemeen aanvaard is als ruilm­iddel. Geld is onged­iffer­entie­erde koopkracht hetgeen betekent dat geld niet aan bepaalde goederen is gebonden, maar altijd wordt aanvaard.De functies van geld zijn: ruilmiddel, reken­eenheid en oppot­middel. De eerste twee noemt men de oorsp­ronke­lijke functies, de derde de afgeleide functie.De ruilm­iddel­functie maakt de indirecte ruil mogelijk, waardoor vergaande arbei­dsver­deling (= speci­alisa­tie) mogelijk is geworden, met als gevolg een grote toename van de arbei­dspro­ducti­viteit. Geld als reken­eenheid maakt het verge­lijken van versc­hille­nde prestaties mogelijk, en de oppot­functie geeft de mogel­ijkheid tot het uitstellen van de consumptie (= sparen).Er zijn een aantal specifieke bezwaren aan ons huidige financiële systeem die zichtbaar worden als je er een meta-analyse op los laat.De Economy Trans­formers community heeft zes dimensies van Econo­mische veran­dering onder­schei­den:1. Ik ben—passie, Hoe ben je bezig?2. Dialoog—uits­trali­ng/aa­ntrek­king, Wat laat je zien?3. Eigendom—wie is eigen­aar/v­erant­woord­elijk­heid, Hoe ga je met vermogen om?4. Organ­iseren—manier van samen­werken, Hoe verbind je je aan elkaar?5. Waarde bepaling — samen­werken /prij­svorm­ing, Hoe komen prestaties tot waarde?6. Aarde—dood en leven­/cycl­isch denken, Hoe ga je om met het milieu?Vanuit deze zes dimensies zijn de volgende problemen en bezwaren van ons huidige systeem benoemd: (Sam­engevat uit: Een verkenning van ons gelds­ysteem)Aarde- De gelde­conomie is losge­koppeld geraakt van de reële economie.- Ons geld funct­ioneert lineair in plaats van cyclisch.- Geld en bankieren zijn monoc­ulturen geworden.Ons systeem van Waard­ebepa­ling kent een aantal funda­mentele problemen:- We kunnen niet alles goed in geld uitdr­ukken, maar beslissen wel op basis van geld.- We hebben weinig zicht op de gevolgen van onze geldk­euzes.- De prijs die wordt betaald voor toege­voegde waarde wordt vaak bepaald door onder­hande­lings­posit­ies.Eigendom- Rente op geld ondermijnt de duurz­aamheid van onze samen­leving.- Onbeperkt eigendom van geld geeft macht die de hele maats­chappij beïnv­loedt.Organ­isati­evorm van het gelds­ysteem- Banken zijn gaan funct­ioneren in dienst van aande­elhou­ders in plaats van het maats­chapp­elijk belang.- Toezi­chtho­uders zijn er niet in geslaagd om de maats­chapp­elijke taak van banken weer centraal te stellen.Dialoog (en de perceptie van geld)- Het gros van de samen­leving begrijpt niet goed hoe geld werkt.- De econo­mische wetenschap ziet geld als iets ‘neut­raals’; geld is niet neutraal.- We meten het succes van onze samen­leving op basis van econo­mische groei.- We geloven dat concu­rrentie de beste prijs oplevert.Ik ben (iden­titeit en intentie)- Geld speelt een grote rol bij het bepalen van onze ident­iteit.- We zijn ons niet ervan bewust dat onze geldkeuzes de economie beïnv­loeden.- We gebruiken ons talent voor werk dat niet de meeste waarde oplevert.Als we een nieuw systeem opzetten zouden deze dimensies dus eerst verkend moeten worden. De (huidige) compl­ement­aire gelds­ystemen kunnen grofweg worden verdeeld in zes categ­orieën:a. Zegelgeld - Dit is een noodg­eldsy­steem uit de jaren ‘30 gebaseerd op het gedac­htegoed van Silvio Gesell (zie kader: Het Wonde­reiland Barat­aria). Het geld wordt minder waardals het niet snel genoeg wordt uitge­geven. Dit voorkomt het oppotten van geld en stimuleert inves­terin­gen in duurzame goederen.b. Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) - LETS is een sociaal ‘mutual credit’ (wede­rzijds krediet) systeem georg­anise­erd door vrijw­illig­ers en zonder winst­oogme­rk. Het is bedoeld om de lokale economie te versterken en richt zich op mensen die anders worden buite­ngesl­oten van het gelds­ysteem, zoals ouderen en gehan­dicap­ten. De eenheden worden gecreëerd door de leden zelf.c. Tijdbanken - Tijdbanken zijn met name gericht op het bevorderen van sociale cohesie door onbetaald (vrij­willi­gers)­werk om te zetten in een waardevol goed. Door vrijw­illig­erstijd­punten te geven, bijvo­orbeeld voor elk uur mantelzorg dat ze verlenen, kan het sociale kapitaal binnen een gemee­nschap worden vergroot. Dit biedt mogel­ijkhe­den voorwerklozen en gepen­sione­erden. Door de vergr­ijzing zijn tijdbanken met name in Japan al populair in de zorgs­ector, maar ook Nederland is hiermee bezig.d. Barte­rs/tr­ade exchanges - De moderne Barters zijn een privaat initiatief om bedrijven te versterken zonder hulp van de overheid. Het zijn online hande­lspla­tformen of boekh­oudsy­stemen met winst­oogme­rk, waarbij gehandeld wordt in Business-to-Business ‘trade credits’. Deze zijn vrij van rente, maar hiervoor worden wel trans­actie­kosten in rekening gebracht. Comme­rciële Barters (zoals de WIR in Zwits­erland) richten zich op het MKB en funct­ioneren op regionaal niveau, zodat geld niet ‘weglekt’. Corporate Barters zijn gericht op grote bedrijven.e. Regiogeld - Geld dat alleen binnen de regio kan worden gebruikt, zoals de Brixton pound in het Verenigd Konin­krijk, zorgt ervoor dat lokale economieën (met name krimp­gebie­den of ontwi­kkeli­ngsre­gio’s) beter worden bediend en dat geld niet weglekt. Het speciale regiogeld kan tegen betaling weer worden ingew­isseld voor conve­ntion­eel geld.f. Commercial Credit Circuits (C3) - Dit is een Business-to-Business compl­ement­aire munt, bedoeld om de liqui­ditei­tspos­itie van het MKB te vergroten. Er wordt een lokaal online platform gecreëerd waarop MKB’ers kunnen handelen zonder eerst te hoeven wachten op hun geld.Het eerde­rgeno­emd PDF document Een verkenning van ONS GELDS­YSTEEM - Problemen en mogelijke oplos­singen. kan wellicht als basis dienen voor ons verkennend onderzoek en dialoog.De Gids voor een gemee­nscha­psmunt (vertaling van Community Currency Guide van Bernard Lietaer en Gwendolyn Hallsmith) bied een framewerk voor een zelf op te zetten munt.*** knip / knip ***Datgene wat je aandacht geeft groeit. Vertaalt naar financiële systemen: datgene waar je geld (waarde) aan geeft of naartoe stuurt dat groeit.Het gaat om het totale econo­mische en maats­chapp­elijke ecosysteem waar geld een onderdeel van uitmaakt.Zowel Bernard Lietaer, NEF als Economy Trans­formers gaan uit van een ecosysteem al beschouwen ze dit elk op een eigen wijze.Lietaer noemt bijvo­orbeeld de universele balans in een natuurlijk (duurzaam) systeem: Efficiency (doorvoer) enResilience (weer­baarh­eid om grote veran­derin­gen aan te kunnen en te overleven) die in ons huidige politieke en bancaire systeem in disbalans is geraakt. NEF maakt in haar publi­caties vele verwi­jzingen naar Inter­depen­dence en ecolo­gische resources en gaat bijvo­orbeeld uit van Natural Economies. Economy Trans­formers wil een bijdrage leveren aan het realiseren van een economie die weer in harmonie en balans is met mens en natuu­r/aarde. Voor mij alledrie alles­behalve een aanbe­veling van het huidige monetaire systeem.Mis­schien even een zijsprong naar een andere disci­pline, de Energie Psych­ologie. Caroline Myss, intuïtief medicus, heeft het in haar vroege boeken over de Energie Anatomie van het menselijk lichaam en ze gebruikt de metafoor van de energ­etische bankr­ekening waar 100 krediet per dag ingaat en wat normaal wordt verdeeld naar activ­iteit­en, projecten, relaties en de gemee­nschap. Je kunt ook energie-lekken hebben waarbij het je meer energie kost dan er per dag in gaat. Het gaat bijvo­orbeeld om gedachten die niet uit je hoofd gaan, onver­werkte issues, trauma&#039;s, stress, ongeï­nspir­eerd werk. Deze energie wordt geleend van je licha­amsce­llen en organen. Indien deze lening / schuld een struc­tureel karakter krijgt raakt je lichaam in disbalans en wordt het ziek. Door verwe­rking, loslaten en vergeving is het mogelijk de energie te balanceren en vanuit perso­onlijk potentieel te groeien.Als je energie vervangt door geld en lichaam door het financieel systeem zie je dat de overe­enkom­sten bijzonder zijn. Myss gebruikt trouwens meer financiële metaforen in haar werk: trauma&#039;s en (psyc­holog­ische) wonden worden volgens haar vaak ingezet als straat-geld (street currency) omdat daar aandacht en vaak extra zorg tegenover staat.[Sp­iritu­ele verwi­jzingen behalve Caroline Myss zijn: Eckhart Tolle &#039;De Kracht van Nu&#039; en Energy Medicine en Psych­ologie: EFT, MIR en Ho&#039;op­onopono (met name vanwege de veran­twoor­delij­kheid en verge­ving)]Door bij het ontwerp van een compl­ement­air systeem bewuste (en trans­paran­te) keuzes te maken kies je ervoor bepaalde kernw­aarden (zoals bijvo­orbeeld duurz­aamhe­id, ecologie, of sociaal kapitaal) meer belang te geven dan alleen de econo­mische waarde in Euro&#039;s. Door meerdere compl­ement­aire systemen toe te voegen neemt in alle gevallen de weerb­aarheid van het gehele economisch ecosysteem toe. De vraag is natuurlijk wel hoe foutv­riend­elijk / weerbaar is het verbi­nding­ssyst­eem van Floatnet, kan het bijvo­orbeeld bestaan zonder centrale admin­istra­tie of in extreme gevallen zonder elekt­ricit­eit?Als meest primaire basis-valuta welke praktisch ontstaat bij waard­ecrea­tie is de Minuto:Het hele Minuto systeem wordt kort uitgelegd in een half uur, waarna je het zelf kunt dupli­ceren. Als je niet de tijd hebt om alles te bekijken bekijk dan in ieder geval naar het stukje van John Croft (vanaf 21.20)Het grootste manco van veel compl­ement­aire geld-systemen is dat ze geen complete productie en econo­mische leven­scyclus bestr­ijken, waardoor schee­fgroei in het systeem komt wat ergens gecor­rigeerd moet worden. Dat kan aan de kant van de overheid door betaling / belasting in alter­natieve munt te accep­teren, door terug­ruilg­arant­ie, of door een gesloten (semi­)auta­rkische eenheid. De matchmaker-functie lijkt bij Barter, LETS en Timebanks de grootste beperking. Het feit dat een aantal compl­ement­aire initi­atieven uit het verleden vooral gedraaid hebben dankzij gesub­sidie­erde krachten die zichzelf niet konden terug­verdi­enen heeft het onder­nemer­schap en daarmee de vitaliteit / zelfr­edzaa­mheid van deze systemen en de affiniteit van onder­nemers met dergelijke systemen volgens mij geen goed gedaan.KostenEen in het algemeen wat onder­belicht aspect van geld &amp; banks­ystemen zijn de kosten ervan. Dan heb ik het hier dus niet over de sociale, maats­chapp­elijke, culturele of ecolo­gische kosten (en opbre­ngsten) maar alleen de econo­mische kosten: de hoogte van de (even­tuele) marge of fee op trans­acties en/of de kosten van lidma­atsch­ap, gebruik, terug­wisse­lopslag / boete, negatieve rente, bemid­delin­gsfee, etc. Wat kost een zgn. slapend lidma­atschap voor incid­entele handel (1 of 2 trans­acties per jaar)? 10, 25, 50Kun je dit aangeven voor Floatnet of hangt dat van de afzon­derli­jke valuata af?Metageld (tussengeld)Floatnet.org: ***knip / knip***(mijn reactie) Je hebt blijkbaar een bruuske agitatie tegen het huidige door rente en hebzucht aange­wakke­rde inflatoire monetaire systeem wat nog slechts voor ca. 5%(?) gedekt wordt door goud (* 612 ton goud, t.w.v. 24 miljard waarvan ca. 10% in Amsterdam?) en de blijkbaar ervaren schaarste bepaalt door regels van de recht­staat.In je uitee­nzett­ing zeg je dat niemand iets kan doen aan de schaarste terwijl er toch al diverse regiogeld en barte­rsyst­emen draaien. Volgens mij is het faill­issem­ent een noodz­akelijk veref­fenin­gsmec­hanisme om oneve­nredige waard­ecrea­tie of schuld en disbalans binnen het financiële systeem te voorkomen aangezien het gehele vermogen wordt verdeeld over de schul­deise­rs. Een stabiel (betr­ouwba­ar) regionaal geld-alter­natief is een waarde-valuta die door grond­stoff­en, goederen of produ­ctiem­iddelen wordt gedekt. Het is dan een directe vorm van community-gewaa­rdeerd schul­dpapier zoals de eerde­rgeno­emde Minuto. De waarde ontstaat pas bij het handelen. Fract­ioneel eigen­aarsc­hap en crowd­funding(waaronder shared funding in natura) zouden inves­terin­gen mogelijk kunnen maken.Gron­dstof­fen en halff­abrik­aten kunnen ook dienen als ruilmiddel in de vorm van verha­ndelb­aar waard­epapi­er. Volgens mij is er niet zoveel nodig om een Micro­finance-markt­plaats &amp; crowd­funded bank (naar het voorbeeld vanKiva) op te zetten. Als je er een markt­plaats + veili­ngmod­ule voorzet waar je producten en diensten omzet naar de nieuwe valuta heb je een bruikbaar (rent­evrij) waard­esyst­eem.De uitgifte en verha­ndeling van (toek­omsti­ge) opbrengst-vouchers (Met waarde bijv. een appel, ei, melk, meel, taart, geplakte band, 30 minuten werk, o.i.d.) kan in mijn ogen gefor­ceerde euro-schaarste, zeker op lokaal en regionaal niveau, prima overb­ruggen. Omdat belas­tingen een door wet gedekte vordering zijn wat normaliter in Euro&#039;s voldaan dient te worden, maar gemeenten ook belang hebben bij sociale cohesie en de praktische uitvoering van bepaalde diensten m.b.t. openbare en publieke ruimten, zou een gemeente het hiervoor besch­ikbare budget in de vorm van regiogeld besch­ikbaar kunnen stellen en regionaal direct of indirect als belas­tingb­etaling kunnen accep­teren. Mijn voorkeur heeft een circulair alter­natief of compl­ement­air gelds­ysteem waarbij grond­stoff­en, producten, arbeid (dien­sten), handel en (lokale) belas­tingen deel uitmaken. Nog even een aanvulling op jouw wegen-metafoor: Bewus­tword­ing en her-ijking van de grenzen van een systeem of infra­struc­tuur hoort voor mij bij een veran­twoord groei- en trans­forma­tiepr­oces. De hoeve­elheid gelij­ktijd­ige auto&#039;s (stond voor valuta) op een snelweg (mogelijke zakelijke trans­acties) bepalen niet de files en congestie (jouw perceptie van schaa­rste). De files en gebru­iksbe­perki­ngen worden met name veroo­rzaakt bij bekende knoop­punten (mark­tplaa­tsen) die blijkbaar met (te?) strikte regels, centrale regie en gedwongen winke­lnering (van verplicht gebruik van bepaalde valuta) worden bedreigd. Mijn punt blijft dat de aandacht vooral naar optimale match­making en waard­euitw­issel­ing uit zou moeten gaan, zoveel mogelijk aansl­uitend bij aanwezig potentieel en (reeds besch­ikbaar) kapitaal. Onhoudbare schuld (waarbij de theor­etische maximale aflossing sowiezo meer dan 7 jaren duurt, (sommigen zeggen 10 jaar overe­enste­mmend met de maximale terug­verdi­entijd van inves­terin­gen) moet te allen tijde vermeden worden. Doordat je de houdbare grenzen van het gelds­ysteem herkent en hopelijk handhaaft, zou je met compl­ement­air regiogeld wat mij betreft dus vooral op markt­plaat­sen met meerdere valuta moeten aansturen. *** knip / knip ***Er zijn binnen ons maats­chapp­elijk ecosysteem zeker wel mogel­ijkhe­den om met behulp van alter­natieve &amp; compl­ement­aire gelds­ystemen &#039;het roer om te gooien&#039;. Mijn uitga­ngspunt blijft dat de markt­plaat­sen de arena&#039;s zijn waar vraag en aanbod elkaar ontmoeten en trans­acties ontstaan, minstens zo belangrijk zijn als een circu­laire, regionale munt of andere uitwi­sseli­ngsbe­vorde­rende inter­acties. Mijn perso­onlijke overt­uiging is dat het benodigd potentieel en kapitaal reeds in het systeem aanwezig is, en dat dit op een handige en slimme manier via compl­ement­aire systemen onsloten kan worden. Compl­ement­aire gelds­ystemen hebben alle hun eigen sterke en zwakkere punten als het gaat om indiv­iduele trans­acties. Schaarste in één gebied los je het eenvo­udigst op door compe­nsatie (via conversie of trans­forma­tie) van overvloed uit een ander gebied. Veel werkl­oosheid betekent relatief veel besch­ikbare arbei­dstijd, veel gescheiden afval­stromen betekent (C2C) herni­euwbare grondstof en handel daarin. De wegen die je kiest (soorten trans­acties) refle­cteren de keuzes van de onder­nemin­gen die producten en diensten leveren en de gebruikers / afnemers ervan. Ecolo­gische waarden (mvo &amp; duurz­aamhe­id) zullen bijvo­orbeeld volgens trend­rappo­rtages direct of indirect een factor zijn bij het handelen binnen het grote maats­chapp­elijke ecosysteem niet zozeer uit ethisch besef, maar vooral omdat het lonend is.Modulaire recycling en upcycling van producten zou eigenlijk vanuit het systeem gesti­muleerd of beloond moeten worden. Als ik hieraan syste­emvoo­rdelen kan koppelen (zoals bijvo­orbeeld een lager trans­actie­tarief) dan zou ik dat waars­chijn­lijk doen.Mijn tijd is wel schaars, maar dit onderwerp is belangrijk en waars­chijn­lijk eerder vroeger dan later urgent. Het is in mijn ogen op dit moment niet opportuun om veel aandacht te besteden aan de aanst­ichters en het mede door de gelds­chaar­ste ontstane macht­sblok. Wellicht kunnen we ons laten inspireren door het IJslandse voorbeeld bij het ter veran­twoor­ding roepen en opschonen van het financieel systeem.Ik ben voors­tander van een weerbaar systeem waarbij natuu­rlijke correcties kunnen plaat­svinden. Faill­issem­ent is niet noodz­akeli­jk, maar zou wel mogelijk moeten zijn. Het ondanks een feitelijk failliet toch redden van zgn. zieke syste­emban­ken en direct of indirect ook landen zorgt voor onwen­selijke , zeer langdurige schul­dendruk met bijbe­horende schee­fgroei in het systeem. Het intro­duceren van systeem-immuun ESM onkruid, wat zich met invloed, regels en voorw­aarde­lijke leningen vooral nestelt bij financieel zwakke landen, doet in mijn ogen ook meer kwaad dan goed.In mijn verhaal had ik jouw (subj­ectief) ervaren gelds­chaar­ste overg­enomen en jouw aanname dat het allemaal centraal aange­stuurd wordt. Ik weet niet eens zeker of er überhaupt wel sprake is van (absolute) schaarste of misschien iets anders.Misschien is het liqui­ditei­tspro­bleem wel een cashflow-probleem of kapitaal-frict­iepro­bleem. Zoals frictie-werkl­oosheid wordt veroo­rzaakt door fricties op de arbei­dsmar­kt. Genoemde variabelen bij frict­iewer­kloos­heid zijn (a)werkl­oosheid, (b) vacatures, (C) loonkosten - wig - nettoloon. Kwali­tatieve variabelen zijn (d) scholing en (e) spreidingvan de arbei­dsmar­kt. Als ik deze verge­lijking doortrek zou het bij kapitaal-frictie gaan om (a) de hoeve­elheid besch­ikbaar krediet, (b) de kapit­aalbe­hoefte. De rente wig (c) het verschil tussen bank-rente­tarief en krediet-rente­tarief. Scholing is (d) vergroting van producten en diensten aanbod van financiele producten, en spreiding is het (e) leveren aan of facil­iteren van specifieke markten.Die 5% dekking is ook het verplichte eigen vermogen van een bank, komt een bank daaronder is er direct of indirect sprake van schaarste.Liqui­diteit, het water van het financieel ecosysteemAls de banken het normale irrig­aties­ysteem zijn wat volgens jou bijna is opgedroogd (of stuk) , zou het sociale kapitaal een regenton of waterput zijn, en het compl­ement­aire systemen (waaronder ook vrijw­illig­erswe­rk) zijn dan een gieter, mest, gft-compost, een vijver, of een eigen tuinslang (dist­ribut­iekan­aal) waarmee water (vocht) en voedi­ngsmi­ddelen in het systeem gebracht worden.Goud staat voor een reserve met vaste universeel uitwi­sselb­are tegen­waarde.De wense­lijkh­eid en trans­paran­tie van de tegen­waarde is belan­grijk, ik zou me kunnen voors­tellen dat men bij initiële vragen over betro­uwbaa­rheid of systeem-twijfel (bijv­oorbe­eld of het grote inves­terin­gspro­jecten aankan), een zekere borg of garan­tiest­elling verlangt.Crowd­funding heeft door besch­ikbare techniek en social media een enorm poten­tieel. Zeker als het wederkerig gebruik van hiermee gepro­ducee­rde producten en diensten een onderdeel uitmaken van het circuit. Crowd­funding 1.0 was vooral primair fundr­aising in een andere verpakking (zoals goede doelen shows), met Crowd­funding 2.0 zie je dat de weder­kerige benefits, maar ook het sociale aspect van info-sharing en betro­kkenh­eid steeds belan­grijker is geworden. Met Crowd­funding 3.0 verwacht ik dat co-finan­ciering meer verschuift naar vormen van co-ownership. Daarnaast (en dat is in de context van deze dialoog van belang) verwacht ik dat de aard van de finan­ciering mee-verandert met de komst van alter­natieve en compl­ement­aire valuta. Finan­ciering in de vorm van toegang, waard­ebonnen of in natura door het leveren van grond­stoffen of modulair deel-fabrikaat. Een micro-klus is feitelijk een deel van een grotere klus of project. Waar het onderwijs veranderde van studi­erich­tingen met beroe­pspro­fielen naar proce­sprof­ielen met skill-sets, is de micro-klus volgens mij de organ­isato­rische eenheid die hier het beste op aansluit.Je noemt de wens / voorwaarde voor een combinatie van inwis­selba­arheid (vrije valut­ahand­el) en krediet. De kosten van elk afzon­derlijk valuta-systeem en de in- &amp; omwissel voorw­aarden zijn bepalend voor een zekere mate van specu­latieve invloed in het totaa­lsyst­eem. Voor equal fixed tijdruil / timeb­anking systemen (dat ieders tijd evenveel waard is) zou je misschien naar tussen-valuta oplos­singen moeten zoeken als je directe valuta-specu­laties en onwen­selijke ruil wilt voorkomen. Of is dat ieders eigen veran­twoor­delij­kheid?Sparen en het pensi­oenst­elselIk zie wel het nut van een actieve buffer als een pensi­oenvo­orzie­ning (de huidige functie in ons ecosy­steem); het is (meta­foris­ch) als een grote watertank die regenwater opvangt en gelei­delijk weer uitgeeft. Voor de weerb­aarheid in de toekomst zou een put of irrig­aties­ysteem wellicht kunnen helpen. Als dit gebeurt dan zou dit kunnen betekenen dat pensi­oenfo­ndsen een alter­natieve bankf­unctie gaan vervullen voor infra­struc­turele inves­terin­gen die de deelnemers / doelg­roepen van deze pensi­oenfo­ndsen in de toekomst nodig hebben. Een zorgruil of ruiltijd zorgs­ysteem zou een passende inves­tering kunnen zijn. Het niet-comme­rciële systeem van wehel­pen.nl wat nu op basis van vrijw­illig­heid punten spaart is zou hiervoor best gebruikt of aangepast kunnen worden.Het door ons geschetste rentevrije regionale geld met een actieve rol van de lokale overheden zie ik als een reële mogel­ijkhe­id. De beperking en tegel­ijker­tijd mogel­ijkheid die ik zie is de politieke agenda en de mate waarin politieke en gemee­nteli­jke doels­telli­ngen en processen verwe­zenli­jkt kunnen worden met behulp van dit krediet. Een borg of garan­tiest­elling van een gemeente (of pensi­oenfo­nds) zou een hoop initiële bezwaren kunnen wegnemen.Perso­onlijk zet ik het liefst in op pilots met meerdere markt­plaat­sen met ondermeer rentevrij regiogeld omdat zowelvraag (behoefte), aanbod (pote­ntieel / oplos­sing), en transactie / interactie zichtbaar zijn in een Markt­plaats. Het regiogeld is niet het doel maar blijft een middel. '>Ideeën over geldsystemen</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metaq.blogspot.com/2013/01/werken-met-wat-er-is.html' title='Een van de belangrijkste, en misschien wel de allerbelangrijkste universele benadering van een systeem en mogelijkheden onderzoeken is werken met wat er is. (Spiritueel: acceptatie wat er nu is)Een van de uitgangspunten van Permacultuur is werken met wat er in een bepaalde omgeving is.Uit de Wikipediatekst:Een permacultuurontwerp begint met het nauwkeurig waarnemen en in kaart brengen van een locatie en de gebruikers ervan. Zo kennen we &#039;sectoranalyse&#039; waarin abiotische factoren als zon (en schaduw), wind en neerslag worden onderzocht. Ook andere stromen van energie, mensen en materiaal worden in een sectoranalyse meegenomen. De &#039;zoneanalyse&#039; geeft de tijd en energie weer die door de gebruikers wordt besteed op bepaalde afstand van het centrum van bewoning (huis). Patronen in bodem, vegetatie, dierenpopulaties, cyclische ontwikkelingen en dergelijke worden in kaart gebracht. Door slimme plaatsing van elementen, het vervullen van essentiële functies door meerdere elementen en het gebruiken van elementen met meerdere functies (biodiversiteit) wordt een ontwerp met optimale opbrengst en veerkracht gemaakt. Educatie van gebruikers is een essentieel onderdeel van een goed permacultuurontwerp. In landen als Nederland is het belangrijk om het permacultuurontwerp zo te maken dat er veel zon wordt ingevangen en dat sterke winden worden omgeleid. In droge landen worden de ontwerpen vooral gemaakt voor optimale wateropvang en -behoud. In Jordanië vlakbij de Dode Zee is men bezig een stuk woestijn te vergroenen met behulp van een goed ontworpen permacultuursysteem.[3]Het ontwerp van een systeem laat zich deels leiden door kennis van mogelijkheden met bepaalde gegevens.1.

Create hospitable space: a warm and welcoming environment[?] '>Werken met wat er is</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metaq.blogspot.com/2013/01/ruilsystemen-en-online-marktplaatsen.html' title='AchtergrondVoor een aantal LETS-, Tijdbank (Timebank) en persoonlijke Barter-systeem projecten heb ik gekeken naar de economische (sc)haalbaarheid van een dergelijk valuta ruilsysteem. Ik heb bijvoorbeeld op tijdruilen.nl een Cyclos installatie neergezet en proberen dit te configuren voor 4 soorten valuta: Tijd (minuten), Euro (Als inleg, ter conversie naar een andere valuta of als rechtstreeks betaalmiddel), Community-punten (Als beloning zoals gebruikt in zgn. Offer-walls in games e.d. maar ook voor sociaal wenselijk gedrag en sociale cohesie-versterkende activiteiten.LETS, (via een Interlets-systeem kunnen de vele Lokale Goederen en Dienstenruil-systemen gekoppeld worden)De geïnstalleerde versie van Cyclos is wat verouderd, maar met het nieuwe Cyclos systeem 3.73 lijkt een universele gedistribueerde betaalkoppeling (zoals bijvoorbeeld de welbekende Paypal-betaalknop) een mogelijkheid te worden. Er is met deze nieuwe versie naast de eerder door STRO ontwikkelde SMS-koppeling ook Cyclos smartphone-apps inclusief POS (Point Of Sale) module waarmee theoretisch door iedereen met een telefoon, tablet of computer (micro)betalingen kunnen worden gedaan. Het is nu alleen nog even de tijd vinden het te installeren en dan, dan ..... ja precies wat dan?MarktplaatsenMet alleen een marktplaats infrastructuur ben je er (zonder marketing) nog niet, maar ook bij veel reeds bestaande (potentiële) ruil of barter-gebruikersgroepen gaat het moeizaam: Waarom lukt niet om vraag en aanbod voor kleine (micro)klusjes (micro-jobs) en handel in Nederland van de grond te krijgen? De Economische crisis en daaruit voortvloeiende grotere werkloosheid heeft niet geleid tot verbeterde ruil-handelsperspectieven. Heel veel Lets-systemen draaien eigenlijk op een veel te laag pitje. Je ziet wel dat er specifieke niches bedient worden bijv. voor maaltijden: thuisafgehaald.nl waar een beetje kok zijn eigen maaltijd mee kan verdienen. Het recentelijk ook door de overheid en zorgverzekeraars gestimuleerde wehelpen.nl biedt met de 6 credits per uur een (gesloten) marktplaats voor lokale hulp en diensten, maar hiervan zou je ook theoretisch (nog) niet kunnen leven. Op het moment dat gemeenten deze zorg-credits accepteren als betaling voor bijv. gemeentelijke belastingen, én als deze credits vrij verhandeld kunnen worden wordt dit natuurlijk een ander verhaal.Er zijn diverse marktplaats initiatieven opgezet met elk een eigen sterke kant. Marktplaats.nl, die zowel vraag en aanbod in huis heeft, maar ook de iets grotere klusjes via biedplaats.nl. Internationaal zie je dat het succesvolle Fiverr.com met zijn $5 fun micro-job segment velen heeft geïnspireerd tot het zelf maken van een kloon. In Nederland is er Tientjes.net wat hier met €10 per klus of product het dichtst in de buurt komt al is de opzet en filosofie meer sociaal (specifiek op minima gericht) dan economisch of vanuit de hele markt gedreven, sterker nog: als je meer dan 1640 per maand verdient betaal je meer voor lidmaatschap. Volgens mij jaag je daarmee ondernemers weg of zet je er vanuit het systeem zelf een financiële rem op.Ik zou bijvoorbeeld graag iets meer fun en praktisch microwerkaanbod zien zoals op www.fiverr.com. Een marktplaats of marktpartij voor kleine klusjes (micro-jobs). Ik heb het fiverr-script maar invoering is in NL lastig door de hoge betaalkosten van Paypal €0,35 + 3,5% en Ideal kost bij een paymentprovider minimaal €0,49 per transactie en de verplichte BTW van 21% als je het consumenten aanbied. Zo blijft er weinig marge over bij kleine bedragen. Waar blijft die micropayment-oplossing?.... Een voordelige micropayment oplossing was er ook niet op de Webwinkel Vakdagen vorige week; met je mobiel betalen heeft bijvoorbeeld een kostenmarge van ruim 20%. Het Mobile Microjobs filmpje uit 2009 van Marco van Heerde van mobilemicojobs.com is wel prikkelend maar de (concept) site doet niets, is dat een organisatorisch, funding, marketing- of matching probleem? Ik verwijt niemand iets want hier loop ik dus zelf ook tegenaan: ik heb zoveel project-ideeen en zo weinig tijd. Ik hoop juist een deel van mijn klusjes en ideeën te kunnen uitbesteden (of crowdsourcen) via dit systeem dat ik zoek.Als er werkende voorbeelden zijn (bij voorkeur reeds in praktijk beproefd) om op lokaal (micro)niveau klussen en diensten te matchen met waardeuitwisseling (dus geen kale vrijwilligers-marktplaats) hou ik me van harte aanbevolen. Een technische en inhoudelijke match of samenwerking met door gemeenten geïntroduceerdeTalentenbanken om werklozen weer aan het werkt te helpen zie ik zeker als een kans. Ik zou me goed kunnen voorstellen dat TransitionTowns en LETS-kringen hier een faciliterende rol in kunnen spelen, zeker als een deel van de gemeentelijke taken als speelplaatsen en openbare groenvoorziening bijv. via een eetbaar landschap ofgemeenschapstuinen constructie worden uitbesteed. De overheveling van de financiering zou kansen kunnen bieden.Bekijk het enthousiasmerende TED filmpje van Pam Warhurst:http://www.ted.com/talks/pam_warhurst_how_we_can_eat_our_landscapes.htmlWordt ongetwijfeld vervolgd: ik waardeer nuttige links en tips....[Dit artikel werd eerder geplaatst op Mindz.com: http://www.mindz.com/profiles/metaman/blog/22303/Ruilsystemen_en_online_Marktplaatsen ]'>Ruilsystemen en online Marktplaatsen</a></li><li><a class='rsswidget' href='http://metaq.blogspot.com/2012/11/waarom-je-het-filmpje-gangnam-style.html' title='De aanleiding voor deze post: mijn zoon wilde graag op school het filmpje van PSY - Gangnam Style laten zien, hierbij argumenten om het te bekijken. Dit is het (Koreaans) origineel: Mijn zoon van 7 heeft het filmpje naar eigen zeggen waarschijnlijk al meer dan 60 keer bekeken en daarnaast de vele parodieën, imitaties, spin-offs en heel veel op het gangnam style paarden dansje en beat geïnspireerd materiaal.Argument: Als je het woord origineel, imitatie en parodie wilt uitleggen kun je het filmpje bekijken en aan het eind de YouTube-suggesties volgen.Bijzonder aan sommige parodieën is dat het script van het originele filmpjes soms tot op scene en zelfs frame nauwkeurig wordt gevolgd. Er zijn bijvoorbeeld: Minecraft Style, Lego Style, Zombie Style (voor halloween), Gandalf Style, Gangnam Navy Style en heel veel meer, zie o.a.http://theweek.com/article/index/233651/gangnam-style-the-8-best-parodies-of-the-viral-videoAfgelopen jaren heeft Lady Gaga met haar tot-nu-toe meest bekeken YouTube video&#039;s een nieuwe trend gezet met haar extravagante uiterlijk (geïnspireerd door de Glam-Rock uit de jaren &#039;60 en &#039;70), op gebied van kunst-uitingen, experimenten, extreme (sexy) video&#039;s, uiterlijk en kleding. De enorme impact en spin-off subcultuur van PSY&#039;s Gangnam Style (die volgens wikipedia op 15 juli 2012 is uitgebracht) lijkt enorm veel groter en sneller te gaan dan bij de huidige YouTube toppers Lady Gaga of Justin Bieber doordat er ondanks de onverstaanbaarheid van het Koreaans [Gangnam Style vertaald naar NL] sprake is een extra aanstekelijke dans-beat, een meervoudige prijswinnende zelf-relativerende (licht erotisch / controversiële) video, en een virale trend ; eigenschappen in combinatie met social media en hoge smartphone / tablet gebruik boosten de kijkcijfers, maar ook de activering van de subcultuur (eigen home-made versies, imitaties en varianten) met de Gangnam style dans. Het lijkt er bijna op dat als je als trendgevoelige artiest, naam of merk zelf geen &quot;Style&quot;-video hebt gemaakt (of parodie) je er niet bijhoort. Het nummer wordt ook gebruikt voor politieke statements; zie bijvoorbeeld de Mitt Romney Style van College Humor wat is uitgebracht net voor de Amerikaanse verkiezingen van oktober en het Brooklyn Museum support Gangnam Style als support voor de in China gevangen artiest Ai Weiwei. Gangnam Style komt ongetwijfeld terug in het jaaroverzicht en conferences over 2012.De Gangnam Style introduceert een nieuwe dans-stijl / beweging (= argument) zoals we dat eerder ook zagen met de Lambada, de Macarena en de Ketchup Song. Bijzonder is dat zowel de dans als fragmenten uit de clip nu al in shows, clips verwerkt worden en in diverse sport &amp; cultuuruitingen zoals flashmobs.Het origineel is ondertussen (eind nov 2012) ca. 830.000.000 keer bekeken. Nu al het meestbekeken YouTube filmpje allertijden. En met de verschillende varianten van het origineel samen meer dan een miljard keer! (1.000.000.000) dat betekent dus dat gemiddeld 1 op de 6 mensen op onze planeet dit filmpje heeft gezien. Je kunt hier dus met recht het populariteit / grote getallen argument voor gebruiken, zoals Elvis Presley bijvoorbeeld al deed met zijn LP-album uit 1959: &quot;50.000.000 fans can&#039;t be wrong&quot;Een goede (Engelstalige) analyse over de achtergrond van Gangnam Style; o.a. over de Koreaanse upperclass en het Gangnam district (wijk) in Seoul die hier eigenlijk op de hak wordt genomen, de verwijzing naar comedy en parodieën in het filmpje zoals de lift-scene (en links naar vele parodieën op Youtube en afbeeldingen).+ De officiële Wikipedia beschrijving (argument: als er een Wikipedia lemma van gemaakt is, is het de moeite waard om te bekijken / bestuderen) :http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gangnam-stylehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_styleEr is dus ook een Nederlandse Pieten Style (wat dus muziek, dans en beat van het origineel gebruikt met eigen Nederlandse tekst). Zowel het Gangnam Style origineel als de Pieten Style variant zijn inmiddels op het digibord bekeken.

Aanleiding voor gebruik van de OVchipkaart-automaat was een brief van de NS met het verzoek de kortingskaart opnieuw te activeren voor 40% korting in daluren bij een chipkaartautomaat, al bleek deze optie bij dit chipkaart-automaat van Arriva achteraf niet aanwezig.Ik heb met mijn mobiele telefoon de Arriva klantenservice (0900-2022022 : €0,10 p/m + kosten mob. tel.) gebeld toen (15.43) er na 3 minuten nog steeds  “even geduld aub” op het scherm stond na de afdruk. De medewerkster van de Arriva Klantenservice vertelde mij dat de kaart waarschijnlijk wordt ingeslikt, door een monteur zou worden opgehaald en vanaf woensdag 28 september opgehaald kon worden in Groningen. Ik ben de ondertussen gearriveerde trein (15.46) ingestapt naar Groningen. Hoewel mijn persoonlijke gegevens zijn genoteerd en het een persoonlijke OV-chipkaart met foto en naam betreft was opsturen volgens de klantenservice van Arriva niet mogelijk. Een vergoeding voor deze extra reiskosten en reistijd was niet mogelijk. Ook de extra kosten voor vol-tarief in plaats van 40% korting met de ingeslikte kortingskaart wordt niet vergoed.In Groningen wilde ik mijn reis met een OV-fiets vervolgen, echter dat was zonder de ingeslikte NS-OVchipkaart (ondanks het bij de NS servicebalie opgevraagde kaartnummer) niet mogelijk. Het gebruik van de OV-fiets is blijkbaar alleen mogelijk met de bij OV-fiets geregistreerde streepjescode van de NS-OVchipkaart. Het uitprinten van een tijdelijke kopie-pas of streepjescode was niet mogelijk. Een alternatieve of vervangende pas kon niet worden verstrekt en ik kreeg zelfs het advies mijn ingeslikte NS-kaart te blokkeren, echter dan zou mijn tegoed en regionale kortingsproducten automatisch komen te vervallen dus heb ik besloten dat niet te doen. Met de bus verder reizen kon ook niet want mijn OV-tegoed en korting staat op de ingeslikte OV-kaart. Een nieuwe anonieme OVchipkaart uit een geschikt NS automaat zou €7,50 + 2 x €10 minimaal tegoed op kaart €20 = €27,50 kosten en alle reiskosten zijn dan met vol tarief. Tijdverlies: ca. 20 minuten bezig geweest bij de NS service-desk en pogingen bij de NS-stalling om toch een OV-fiets met alleen het kaartnummer te huren. Uiteindelijk ongeveer 35 minuten gelopen naar mijn bestemming (ipv ca. 12 minuten fietsen).1) Mijn verzoek is een rechtvaardige klantvriendelijke directe vervanging &amp; vergoedings-regeling voor een (onterecht) ingeslikte OV-chipkaart inclusief hieraan gekoppelde producten waarbij de eigenaar / gebruiker door de veroorzaker volledig schadeloos wordt gesteld. Een OVchipkaart-slachtoffer toeslag van minimaal €35 per dag moet getroffen reizigers compenseren (o.a. voor verloren tijd, reisvertraging en telefoonkosten) en vervoersbedrijven stimuleren om service te verbeteren en fouten in OVchipkaart-automaten structureel te verhelpen en voorkomen.Op maandagavond 26/9/2011 kreeg ik een mailtje dat ik mijn kaart vanaf heden kon ophalen in de Arriva Store Groningen. Op de website van Arriva staat dat de Arriva Store Groningen op Stationsplein 4, dagelijks open is van 7.00 tot 23.00 uur. http://www.arriva.nl/klantenservice/arriva-stores/Op maandagavond 3 oktober ben ik na een bezoek in Groningen met de auto naar het stationsplein gereden en heb daar om 22.48 (betaald) geparkeerd. Om 22.50 was de Arriva Store in de centrale hal donker en gesloten, ook bij de (verlichte) Arriva kantine bij de bushaltes was niemand aanwezig. De Arriva klantenservice (op 09002022022) die ik uiteindelijk belde om 22.56 uur (misschien had ik de winkel over het hoofd gezien) bevestigde dat de Arriva Store in de hal van het Centraal Station wel open zou moeten zijn en hij had geen verklaring voor het feit dat de Arriva Store dicht was. Ook deze Arriva medewerker gaf aan dat de OV-chipkaart niet opgestuurd kon worden ivm veiligheid en mogelijk verlies in de post. Deze medewerker gaf ook aan dat er geen vergoeding wordt gegeven voor de extra reiskosten en dat ik het nog maar eens overdag moest proberen. Een klacht indienen kon niet telefonisch, maar moet via een mailtje op de website van arriva.nl. De Arriva medewerker kon niet aangeven of er een onafhankelijke geschillencommissie is voor klachten, en gaf me bij voorbaat weinig kans.Het feit dat Arriva ernstig in gebreke is gebleven en mij tot op heden mijn NS-pas niet heeft opgestuurd of kunnen overdragen binnen de zelf aangegeven openingstijd stel ik Arriva volledig aansprakelijk wegens nalatigheid (door afwezigheid). Ik eis dat Arriva mijn OV-kaart per direct opstuurt naar mijn huisadres en een fatsoenlijke compensatie geeft voor alle gemaakte kosten en verloren tijd. 2. Mijn verzoek is een duidelijke vaste regeling met een boete of sanctie bij moedwillige afwezigheid of niet naleven van het SLA met betrekking tot de reiziger (Service Level Agreement)  en verplichte financiële en/of reistijd (reistegoed) compensatie voor benadeelden.

 started taking their exhaustive and autonomous form independent from human

socio-political sciences some notions of these new methodes hoping in their own 
field for the same advance. Those new notions seemed them to be the key to the 
cognitive as well as a technological success of this original way of handling 
scientific problems. Thus, scientism was developed in the XIXth century, and 
afterwards, various attempts to use some notions of cybernetics, of the 
mathematical information theory, of systemic, of Gdelisation, etc. by human 
sciences came to fulfillment in the second half of the XXth century in the same 
hope. However, all these efforts did not give the expected results because human 
sciences are not prepared for this kind of implantation neither by organization 
of their own notions and their language nor by the analysis method and above all 
by the kind of relations with reality.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-GB">But in the 50s and 60s, some cyberneticians  thus 
mathematical sciences  made an attempt to create the theory of social and 
individual human process {SIH processes} as one exact sciences, thanks to which 
a much more reliable management of public affairs should have been got. To 
general surprise, that was also unsuccessful without even knowing why, as quite 
obviously man as well as society are systems in the mathematical meaning of the 
word. And yet, at the end of the second millenium, as the power of sciences and 
technology can destroy our civilization as well as the natural inheritance on 
the world scale, many symptoms of which can already be seen, without either 
contemporary philosophy or Western political model being able to cure them, 
hence the need of an effective theory of this kind representing the genuine 
reality and of a respective science becomes a matter of the utmost urgency.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-GB">After the unsuccessful research the author of final solution 
said vytvorology, undertook in the 70s a research to find first of all an 
answer to the following question : <b>Why was it unsuccessful</b> ? and once the 
answer found, it was necessary to built the additional research tools lacking at 
the time. Gdel incompletion theorem indicated the way to take.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-GB">Indeed, both neurophysiological and psychological aspects are 
characteristic of any SIH process. The former aspect, as a material one, is 
perfectly mastered by exact sciences because the basic propriety of them is not 
its mathematical language as some think, but the phenomenon analysis made in 
this algebra that governs the reality of the observed phenomenon. Hence it was 
necessary to define the algebra of the later aspect in accordance with the 
numerous results of psychological experiments and linked to the former one by a 
well-defined morphism. The creation of this algebra <b>(c-algebra)</b>, as 
directly linked to the description of entropic processes of the brain, and the 
defining its epimorphism with the algebra of physiological phenomena, was made 
at the end of 70s and upheld at the Academy of Sciences in 1981 followed by a 
publication.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">
<span lang="EN-GB">The second tool indispensable to descrbe the SIH processes as 
an exacte science was the discovery that the <b>universal theory</b> expressing 
in mathematical language the dynamics of respective system must be based on a <b>
theory of human values system</b> which is responsible for the establishment of 
individual prorities, then choices etc. , therefore this theory must also be 
presented as a mathematical system, which was made and presented at the same 
time too. This tool answers to the finding that the information  which is 
manipulated  is an inavoidable <b>intermediary</b> between reality and its 
human description whatever the language may be, and more, is an intermediary 
which is likely to be subjectively manipulated. Thus, specifying a certain 
number of notions like those, the <b>intrinsic nature of information</b> or of 
the usefulness of entropy in the field of human phenomena, makes it possible to 
get a coherent and universal image of all the SIH processes with their <b>causal 
mechanism</b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">
<span lang="EN-GB">In addition to this systemic investigation, the research of 
the physical propulsion mechanism of SIH proceses was led by three pemises. At 
first, the examination to find out if there is a solution among <b>simple 
mechanisms</b> as it is almost aways the case in Nature when, with its 
generosity, it finds itsef confronted with complex problems. Secondly, the 
required mechanism must be a <b>powerful physical force</b> in order to face the 
most difficult situations that man can find himself confronted with any day. 
Thirdly, it must be <b>quite a universal mechanism</b> so as to solve all the 
problems in the unforeseeable future at the time of the development of man and 
of his civilization. Hence, the only possible answer is the <b>entropic 
mechanism</b> and indeed examining how it works at the individual level 
(neurophysiological processes) as well as at social level (man as a motor, as a 
subject, and as an object of social processes) has confirmed the validity of 
this discover. Very many examinations of cerebral lesions as well as a 
psychological experimentation as regards the information localization also prove 
its validty.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">
<span lang="EN-GB">The description of the entropy of the neurocerebral system as 
a function of the information of various qualities (the action of values system 
taken into account), hence of various human meanings recorded in the brain, was 
particularly useful and becomes possible thanks to the discovery what the nature 
of the information is independently of the human interpretation (the message) of 
the communication. Thanks to the entropy additivity, this presentation can 
describe the intervention of all the active agents (neurotransmitters, electric 
charges, hormones) of the neurocerebral system in the physical causal chain : 
stimulation  thinking  choice  action of the executing organs (vocal organs, 
muscles etc). It makes it possible to put quite clearly how the <b>manipulation 
of the information</b> is expressed by the change in the entropy characteristic 
for each type of processes, thus in practical terms, <b>how a neurophysical 
event is expressed by psychic phenomenon and human or social process</b>. 
Lastly, according to the values of some measurable parameters, it also become 
possible to show the different political and economic models as the <i>
particular cases</i> foreseen by <b>a sole and universal theory of civilization</b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">
<span lang="EN-GB">Basing the society mechanism on the physics of the 
neurophysiological phenomena, it was thus possible to provide this theory with 
the value of a <b>truth of the absolute type</b> (only physics is endowed with 
this kind of capacity), which is inaccessible to the methods of traditional 
sciences. This way also gave birth to <b>vytvorology</b> which  thanks to its 
original method  is an exact science of social and individual human processes, 
recognized as the third family of sciences, nearly human and traditional exact 
sciences. This new science profits from the experimental knowledge of psychology 
as well as of brain neurophysiology its experimental support, and then it was 
possible to formulate on this basis the complete <b>political vytvorology</b> as 
an exact science too, which Enlightenment philosophy fundamental mistakes bares 
and dangers of the liberal democracy defines. It is of a great cognitive and 
practical importance, that vytvorological formal analysis prove the function of 
human values system identical in social processes as this one of <b>DNA</b> in 
the living organism : it is <i>this system which determines the characteristic 
of any society</i> and the kind of its dynamics.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">
<span lang="EN-GB">In other words, vytvorology with its reliability can be 
considered as an <b>extension of physics</b> in this particular environment, 
where both agents of action (two physical bodies) exchanging energy or any other 
kind of matter (as in social processes) to give birth to an event producing the 
process, cant interchange it directly but 1 are separated by an intermediary 
and 2 the characteristic of which is manipulated by man, thus an intermediary 
known as information. Hence, it gives a vision of human and social processes 
that is a <b>coherent whole</b> with the description of material Universe made 
by physics, explaining at once the mechanism of transition from material to 
human or spiritual, and to social.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 120%; margin: 0 60; text-indent:50">
<span lang="EN-GB">As strange as it may seem, thanks to this methode it was 
possible not only to develop the general &nbsp;civilization theory and to analyse the 
material aspect of human life, but also the spiritual aspect of our being. 
Hence, this theory reveals the logic and philosophy included in the reality of 
mankind, explaining human diversity. Thus, the image of human presence on Earth 
in unity with all Universe is done.</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i><b>My general orientation focuses on what could be called the <u>theoretical
  foundations of general semantics</u>.</b></i></p>
  <p><i>Korzybski's frequent quotations from all the major philosophers,
  together with his emphasis on mathematics (my first love), the methods of
  science, and his other attributions to great philosophers and scientists, all
  pointed directly to philosophy in general, to epistemology and metaphysics in
  particular, and specifically to the philosophy of science, as the primary
  source knowledge of general semantics. As a direct result of my exposure to
  general semantics, in
  conjunction with my own extensive mathematics, physics, engineering, <a href="../navy/index.html">military</a>,
  and computer
  science backgrounds, I went into the study of philosophy with the explicit
  purpose of clarifying the theoretical foundations of general semantics.</i></p>
  <p><i><b>Many self-avowed general semanticists lack the necessary technical
  background knowledge.</b></i></p>
  <p><i>In <a href="gs-bio.html"> my personal experience</a>, a great many of the participants at seminars
  that I attended lacked the science, mathematics, and logic education and
  backgrounds necessary to appreciate these foundational areas of general
  semantics - areas that Korzybski emphasized frequently.&nbsp; Some of these
  individuals have gone on to become significant participants in the overall
  administration of the organizations presenting themselves as
  &quot;official&quot; organs of general semantics in our culture. These
  developments are actually a natural consequence of the theory as applied to
  organizations. <a href="abstract.html"> Abstraction</a> also occurs from generation to generation in
  organizations. This directly contributes to the evolution of the purposes and
  aims of the organizations. The results are that the attention and focus on
  reviewing and revising the theoretical foundations is falling by the wayside
  as organizations and individuals concentrate on applying a limited abstraction
  of relatively static principles, behaviors, and methods, resulting in a
  degeneration into a major emphasis on justification of the chosen behavioral
  prescriptions by referring to the original writings of Korzybski himself.</i></p>
  <p><i><b>General semantics, as any other symbolic environment, has its
  benefits and its difficulties.</b></i></p>
  <p><i>The major focus of many self-avowed general semanticists today seems to me to
  be aimed at applying a relatively few static extractions related to
  prescriptions for how to behave.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this emphasis seems to
  be at the expense of an adequate understanding of the reasoning behind the
  prescriptions for these behaviors.&nbsp; As a result, the &quot;practice&quot; of general
  semantics falls largely into the category of self-improvement programs.&nbsp; As a testimonial,
  I met one couple at a seminar who stated that they had been to all the major
  seminars of this nature, including Primal Scream, EST, various yoga and
  meditation seminars, etc., etc.&nbsp; Their evaluation of the general semantics
  seminar was stated, &quot;General semantics has it all!&nbsp; It's the best.&quot;&nbsp;
  Unfortunately, this same couple skipped most of the theoretical lecture portions of
  the general semantics seminars - lectures at which Stuart Mayper presented the
  mathematical backgrounds of relativity, the logical backgrounds of <a href="../article/popper.html"> Popper's
  philosophy of science</a> and the principle of falsification, and other
  theoretical background information.</i></p>
  <p><i><b>General semantics must be applied to itself.</b></i></p>
  <p><i>The failure to update general semantics contributes directly to its lack
  of acceptability in modern scientific, philosophical, and educational
  circles.&nbsp; The loss of expertise in the theoretical foundations
  contributes directly to the view that general semantics is becoming a cult of
  practitioners who continually cite &quot;chapter and verse&quot; from
  Korzybski's original writings. As Korzybski himself frequently emphasized,
  general semantics must be continually re-evaluated and updated in the light of
  new knowledge.&nbsp; Its very foundations must be subject to the same critical
  review and testing that all scientific knowledge continually gets as new
  discoveries are made.&nbsp; So, among these pages, you will find a fresh
  viewpoint - one that critically applies general semantics to itself.&nbsp;
  Included among my comments and discussions, I
  will not hesitate to point out fallacies, fads, flaws, and failures that have come to weigh
  down the continued progress and development of general semantics.</i></p>
  <p><i>Bearing in mind the foregoing caveat, please proceed to my perspective
  on general semantics, and do not hesitate to <a href="../mail/index.html">send
  me your comments and feedback</a>.</i></p>

<p><b>As a theory</b>, general semantics &quot;is&quot; a forerunner of <a href="gesum.html">
evolutionary epistemology</a>.&nbsp; It predates <a href="gesum.html">
evolutionary epistemology</a>
and could be called &quot;neo-&quot;logical positivism.&nbsp; (Charlotte Read
pointed out that while general semantics is similar to 
<a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-logical-positivism.htm">logical positivism</a>, it
also differs in some respects.)&nbsp; Stuart Mayper identified <a href="../article/popper.html">Popper's Philosophy of Science</a>
as best illustrating the methodological approach espoused by general semantics.&nbsp;</p>

  <li>All knowledge is in the form of maps - including non-verbal as well as
    verbal maps.&nbsp; This includes &quot;maps&quot; that are &quot;inside the
    skin&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Map&quot; is a very general term.&nbsp; Maps are to
    be distinguished from &quot;territories&quot;, an equally general term. It
    can be said that the only thing that all maps have in common is &quot;<a href="structure.html">structure</a>&quot;,
    hence the statement, &quot;Structure is the only content of knowledge&quot;
    is often quoted.&nbsp; While all maps are <a href="structure.html">structures</a>,
    not all <a href="structure.html">structures</a> are maps.</li>
  <li>Maps are produced by the process of <a href="abstract.html">abstracting</a>, whether in the nervous
    system or at verbal levels. Maps are the result of abstracting from
    territories. It is viewed that &quot;good&quot; knowledge consists of maps
    which have &quot;<a href="similar.html">similarity of structure</a>&quot;
    with their represented territories.</li>
  <li>The basic principles of <a href="coa.html"> consciousness of abstracting</a> are the caveats
    (often called the ABC's of general semantics):
    <ol>
      <li>The map is not the territory.</li>
      <li>The map doesn't cover all the territory.</li>
      <li>The map reflects the map maker. (see <a href="mapmaker.html">The "C" of general
        semantics</a>.)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Although not stated, the purpose of maps is to permit successful
    navigation of the appropriate territories, whether it is finding one's way
    around in a grocery store or solving complex engineering problems, etc..</li>
  <li>Maps must be tested &quot;empirically&quot;.&nbsp; One must constantly
    strive to corroborate and update the maps one uses, to the extent of developing an
    extensional orientation and using extensional devices to reduce the
    likelihood of error. <a href="../article/popper.html">Popper's Philosophy of Science</a>
    best illustrates the methodological view espoused by General Semantics as a
    discipline.</li>
  <li>It is not possible to find out when a map is &quot;correct&quot;, but it
    is possible to find out when a map is &quot;wrong&quot;.&nbsp;Maps

  <blockquote>
    <h3>The world view of general semantics</h3>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>General semantics views the world as multi-dimensional, multi-causal, and
multi-level, and that organisms can never be isolated from their environments.
The primary dimensions are energy, space, and time.&nbsp; Living organisms can
be classified according to which type of binding they predominately do.&nbsp;
Plants bind energy.&nbsp; Animals, through their territoriality and mobility,
bind space.&nbsp; Humans, through their use of language and planning bind
time.&nbsp; No events occur in isolation, and organisms cannot be separated from
their environments, so many factors affect both, such that there is normally no
single cause for something. As maps are of territories, and each map can be the
territory for a new map, events can be viewed from many levels (of
abstracting).&nbsp; Any organism, person, group, etc., can be viewed from many
levels, but can only be known about by the <a href="coa.html"> process of
abstracting</a>, so cannot be
viewed apart from its environment.&nbsp; I use the run-on phrase
&quot;<a href="organism.html">organism-in-its-environment-as-a-whole</a>&quot; as opposed to the often cited
phrase &quot;<a href="organism.html">organism-as-a-whole-in-its-environment</a>&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <h3>The application of general semantics</h3>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary application of general semantics is in training individuals to
view their environments using the general semantics world view, to think in
terms of levels of abstraction, to use the extensional devices, to become aware
of making assumptions, to extensionally check them out, and to be prepared for
them to be wrong.</p>

<p>The claim of general semantics is, that by applying its methods, disagreement
will be reduced, some psychological disorders can be overcome, and reasoning
will be improved.</p>

<P><h2>Abstract</h2>
<P>Claudia Krenz, Ph.D. (datafriend @ gmail-.-com) 
<P>
This is a web page  about  a logistic regression,   the first one  
interpreted <a name="x1"></a><a  href="#y1"><sup>1</sup></a>
in   <U>The Bell Curve</u> (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, New York: The Free Press, 1994).  
There has been much discussion of the  book but no examination of this or 
any other of its published analyses.
<u>The Bell Curve</u> continues to generate discussion and influence U.S. social and educational policy. Its conclusions were based on the authors' interpretations of the results of 100 separate statistical analyses (logistic regressions). Although printouts from all analyses were included in one of the book's appendices, the authors were criticized for publishing them without having earlier submitted them to peer review.

<P> 
 
<table cellpadding=5><tr>
<td valign=top> 

<p>
Despite these--and many other--objections, there has been no investigation 
of the published statistical analyses on which the book's conclusions were 
based. The same simple statistical model was used throughout: 3 variables--scores on the Armed 
Services Qualifying Test (AFQT), a socioeconomic status index (SES), and 
AGE. This model was used to predict 100 different outcomes for different 
subgroups of the  Bureau of Labor Statistics' venerable National Longitudinal Survey of 
Youth (NLSY). HM argue that AFQT scores are a measure of intelligence.  
Almost all their analyses were logistic regressions, including the 
one examined here, the first discussed in the book.

<p>  
This page examines the book's  statistical 
output (Appendix 4, p. 622) and the authors' interpretation (Chapter 5, p. 
127). In this analysis, HM used their 3-variable model to 
predict whether   white NLSY cases lived above or below the POVERTY level. HM took AFQT and 
SES scores from the beginning of the  NLSY and used them, along 
with their AGE covariate, to predict POVERTY a decade later.

Murray   made the book's data public long ago: Anyone with an internet connection can 
download them. The sample reported in the book's first analysis is obtained 
by excluding, from  the higher-income NLSY X-Sectional subsample,  all but white non-students--without missing values on any of the 
4 analysis--AFQT, SES, AGE, &amp; POVERTY--variables   (N=3367). While HM used 
JMP, any commercially available statistical package can be used. Replication 
of the first analysis with STATA yielded numbers identical to those published. 
HM did not, however, examine their residuals; I did. 

<p>
<b>HM knew not to interpret their data analysis   
without  examining the fit of their model--here, the 3 above mentioned 
variables. HM   wrote that "the usual measure of 
goodness of fit for multiple regressions [is] R-square" (p. 617). Based on 
the R-square statistic, HM concluded their model adequately fit their data.  
Murray, however, subsequently learned otherwise, later referring to 
R-square as "ersatz and unsatisfactory" in this context (1995).

Another way to examine the fit of a statistical model in a logistic 
regression is the classification table, an intuitively obvious cross-tabulation 
of the predicted status of cases by their actual status: here, a cross-tabulation 
of whether cases predicted by HM's 3-variable model to be above or below the poverty level actually were or were not.</b>
<p>
<b>After obtaining results identical to those published (down to four significant 
digits), the fit of HM's model was addressed by examining its classification 
table: HM's model predicted <font color="red">n</font><font 
color="blue">o</font><font color="red">n</font><font color="blue">e</font> of the cases living below 
the poverty level correctly (N=244):  all  were  
 incorrectly  predicted to be living 
above it. Interpreting the results of this first analysis 
is meaningless, because    it predicts none of its cases of interest 
correctly: the Analysis section below shows my replication of HM's published 
analysis (and its corresponding classification table). The Subjects section 
describes the NLSY and the Data section, the variables used in the analysis. </b>
<p><ul><li>
In 1997, when I discovered this--that the model used throughout the book fit the 
data in the first analysis as poorly as imaginable (can't get worse than 
0% predicted correctly)--I decided to post my results on the internet. So 
anyone, anywhere, anytime could read them, so this knowledge would not be 
hidden behind subscription walls, accessible to a few.  It was a proud 
moment when I discovered this page linked by  a Texas used car dealer page.
I mean "proud" most seriously: I do believe the internet can serve as a 
leveler of leverage, has the ability to level the playing field. I do 
believe that my resume, although it looks ridiculous containing links such 
as the preceding--no academic style guide offers examples of being cited 
by automobile dealers--constitutes an affirmation of what happens when people are 
given equal access to information.  
<P><li>
One of the central interpretations of the book's statistical analyses was 
that there exists, in the U.S., an "underclass" of disadvantaged people 
who are impoverished,  because 
they are insufficiently intelligent to be anything else (the flip side of 
this argument is that there exists, in the U.S., an "upper class" of wealthy 
people whose status is based on merit, their superior intelligence). An alternative explanation of 
these two Americas is that the playing field is not level, that it has 
become increasingly less level since the massive feeding at the public 
trough that began under Reagan (the state where I live, Alaska, superbly 
illustrates the point).  That the playing field becomes increasingly less level digitally 
concerns me a lot (in the context of the divide that it could, possibly 
still can breach--and to see it being used to widen the gulf shows me how 
wrong I've been about so much).
<p><li>
The role   <U>The Bell Curve</u>--it is now in audio format--has played in justifying 
the two Americas  makes its other 99 analyses of great interest: what if 
they were all as bad as the first?  While none could be worse than the 
first, what if they were all similarly flawed?  Since the same 
3-variable model was used throughout, it is interesting to note that two of 
the model variables, AFQT and SES, are so highly correlated as to raise a 
question of  discriminant validity: If the phenomena that the AFQT and SES measure 
are conceptually different, as HM posit in the book--they interpret AFQT 
scores as IQ scores--then the variables 
measuring them shouldn't be so highly correlated (that high correlation is 
consistent with the two measuring the same thing *sniff, Americans, they 
have such low data quality standards*).

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=10 width="80%"><TR><TD><P ALIGN=LEFT>
 
To partially address this question, the same logistic regression described 
here was repeated on an independent group of subjects, the lower-income NLSY 
Supplemental sample (N=1067). As with the published analysis, the rate of 
false positives was high (around 90%): that's  high enough  to shake the statistical 
moorings   of <U>The Bell Curve</u>'s conclusions. 
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<p>
</ul>
What about the other 99? Concomitant with the rise of the theory of the 
underclass has been the dumbing down of America. Could it be 
that, since genius is not hereditary, that it is those now in power--the 
offspring of those in power when capital started imploding, power began 
consolidating, the playing field began tilting, becoming increasingly 
uneven--could it be that 
they--the rarely in doubt and rarely correct crowd--are making dumber 
and dumber decisions, and the tide is going out with them? 
 
Since the book's other 99 analyses used the same model as its POVERTY 
analysis, all of its interpretations are suspect.

In this section, you'll find links to the data--programs I wrote to read 
them, compute new variables, and run analyses--as well as a bibliography. 
The sections to the right further describe  my replication of  HM's 
POVERTY analysis.

<HR>
You can do exactly as I did: download the data and analyze them (made 
available by Murray, stumbled upon by me  years ago (downloaded on the 
spot--3.5 MB was  a commitment back then--from a still viable link). The 
internet has given  us a new way of making knowledge public--data even more 
than software want to be free, the "entry fee" being in the present example 
a functioning statistical package and unfettered public internet access 
(not even an industrial strength search engine is needed because of URLs, 
links). Setting the level of access to knowledge low is  in the public 
interest, e.g., the empirical history of how the microsoft corporation 
behaved  is a matter of public record (for this you will need that search 
engine):   words   later used to characterize don't alter their having 
occurred: Anyone anywhere anytime can search on a phrase like <a href=" 
http://www.google.com/search?q=inquisition+galileo+%22E+pur+se+muove%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;filter=0">"E

href="http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html">"sharing 
 data"</a> in the decentralized public domain is in the public interest.

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=10 width="80%"><TR><TD><P ALIGN=LEFT>
The commands--what to type to get the output with the same numbers HM 
published in New York City--are simple.  Anyone with a stat package can 
<I>look</I> at its default printout for the kind of analysis conducted by 
HM, "logistic regression," and <I>see</I> the same numbers published on 
the 
first page of their Appendix 4 (down to four decimal points is close 
enough 
to agreement for me). HM are not liars. In Popperian terms, the statement 
"HM made up/conjured/fabricated/prevaricated/etc., their data" can be 
falsified: that I got the same numbers and  so can you  makes  such 
knowledge public:  no need for "journalists." Do it 
yourself, empirically, individually.
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>
Setting the bar for access to knowledge low is in the public interest, as 
is setting the bar for what constitutes knowledge high, i.e., more 
rigorous, a point    
<a href="http://256.com/gray/docs/strong_inference.html">Platt</A> (1964) made strongly--now online.

<P>
HM  did misinterpret their data: You can establish this for yourself as 
easily--publicly and empirically--as the numerical replication of the 
first 
source table in their Appendix 4 discussed above. Just so, that   Radio 
Netherlands  observed that "radio tikrit" included an astrological 
forecast is a matter of fact, public record--but whether that meant that 
the U.S. was trying to convert those within its broadcast range to 
astrology would be a matter of interpretation.
 
<P>
 
HM were criticized for not having submitted their work for "peer review" 
before publication--not sharing it with other academic scientists--"peers" 
in the sense of substance  not   of being employed by U.S. academic 
institutions--as were  Pons and Fleischmann, who  announced "cold fusion" 
to some journalists  in Salt Lake City, Utah [living 200 
miles north at the time, I heard it said on local  news: it's been an 
exciting life I've led]. Would HM's misinterpretation have been 
caught by the "peer review" process (I'd guess it'd depend on the 
journal-- 
as Platt noted, a "lifetime of achievement" in one discipline  being 
equivalent to just a few years in one more rigorous)?

<P>
  Given the prevalence of uncertainty--and being at least as smart as 
 squirrels--humans have instituted epistemological processes like "peer 
 review." An example is a medical journal editor noticing that the 
 manuscript s/he's reviewing reports  more "degrees of freedom"  in the 
 results section than it had "subjects" earlier and decides against 
 publication. Varmus studied  "peer review"--operationalized by extramural 
 review--as an  empirical  process,  using scores aggregated over reviewers 
 and committees as empirical data.  Sometimes "peer review" fails us, 
 e.g.,  publication of methodologically flawed racist articles published 
 in U.S. academic journals in the 1920s  (or worse, in the former 
 totalitarian u.s.s.r., when publication  meant "biologist" Lysenko agreed 
 with you--and if he didn't you'd be lucky to be just in jail). To the 
 extent we forget that "peer review" <I>is</I> an empirical process, we 
 risk "a return to the dogmatism of science of the middle ages and of a 
 number of religions today" (Robertson, 1999). And I think the issue  of 
 public math and "peer review" unavoidable: the first interactive site I 
 found online let anyone specify levels of variables like "prevalence" and 
 "fertility" <a href="http://sauvy.ined.fr:80/popafsi/english/">to compute</a> 
 outcomes like number of orphaned children.

<P>
 By and large though  epistemological behaviors like "peer review" serve us 
 well, errors typically being, as in Student's title, "Errors of Routine 
 Analysis"--positively skewed in terms of impact, i.e., most such errors 
 are mundane.   We must still though remain cognizant of the fact that a 
 "peer reviewed" anything is a tautology, something  reviewed by   someone 
 someone else calls "peer." Galileo's example underscores the importance of 
 who constitutes such  committees--putting the pet theory of Urban VIII, a 
 man with the power to imprison him,  into the words of "Simplicio," the 
 simpleton in a three-way conversation does not strike me as 
 accidental--perhaps Galileo  questioned the <I>authority</I> of "belief" 
 (requiring only "subjective certainty") as a litmus test for knowledge, 
 what he had <a  
 href="http://muse.tau.ac.il/museum/galileo/the_dialogue.html">observed</a>: 
  "E pur se muove," nevertheless it moves.
 
<P>
The public internet has given us a new never-before-in-our-species form of 
<I>decentralized</I> countryless knowledge.  That this page has been cited 
in books with titles like "quantitative genetics" and "multivariate 
analyses"  suggests   that others have used the same data I link to and 
gotten the same results I did (great textbook example:   rare to get an 
unmessy number like 0). It's now less necessary to take anyone's word for 
anything--and that can't help but facilitate the growth of knowledge.   I 
got numbers nearly identical to those HM published in  <U>The Bell 
Curve</u> and, on    examination, noticed that they meant <I>nothing.</I> 
You can follow the links to your right and get exactly the same results as 
I (and HM before). It is beyond the scope of the present page to address 
questions like whether <U>The Bell Curve</u> should be classified as an 
"urban legend" and about <i>poverty</i> (for that I refer the reader to <a 
href="http://www.realchangenews.org/issue/current/index.html">Real 
Change</a>, one of Seattle, WA's better papers, available online and on 
the 
street).  It is the purpose of the present page to empirically examine one 
analysis, the first, the POVERTY analysis.

that  HM's model predicted <i>a few</i> cases living below the poverty 
level correctly. Since HM's statistical analysis says little--in the 
independent group replication--to nothing--in the published 
analysis--about 
cases living below the poverty level, interpretation of its model variable 
coefficients   is unwarranted.

Click on the link above to read about my situationally-grounded 
perspective: philosophy of measurement   and bone 
density.  Call the former "interpretative" and the latter "two standard 
deviations above the mean."  Do I--female--have osteoporosis (I'm not as 
tall as I was--two inches less than the average one--and I have two "risk 
factors"--other variables correlating  with having osteoporosis)? I think 
not, because, based  on   a standard normal distribution, the probability 
of a Type II error is very small.

Less exciting reading is my  <a

resume</a>--most things I do not know how to do: a few, yes.

One of my favorite quotations is from  Martin Heidegger: what's "most 
thought-provoking in these thought-provoking times is that we still are 
not 
thinking."

Although the subjects in this first analysis were <i>whites  only,</i> the

    <LI>We observe that test after test, year after year, 
    American students   score lower on standardized math tests compared to 
    students in other countries:  their standardized scores would be 
    negative numbers on the left side of a "bell curve" or gaussian 
    distribution of standardized math test scores.

We would ask whether the  <i>fact</i> that American students consistently 
score lower on 
standardized math tests means that Americans are less <I><B><font color="navy">intelligent</font></b>.</i>

Were we being rational, we'd want to see evidence  establishing a   link 
between <I><B><font color="navy">intelligence</font></b></i>  and scores on 
standardized math tests (just so, HM tried to establish one  between <I><B><font color="navy">intelligence</font></b></i>  and AFQT scores).

Were we being   being rational, we'd also want to consider evidence from 
other sources, i.e., not rely on scores from a single measure    [a 
"multi-trait multi-method" approach can't help but provide a more rigorous 
and so informed data interpretation]. Here are a few more data points:

<P>

 <uL>
    <LI>In the late 19th century, the State of Indiana  "abracadabra"
    <i>mandated</i>  that pi be  even.

<P>
<LI>In the late 20th century, in 1998, the Alaska State 
Legislature--concerned that <I>big oil companies</i> like Exxon 
(headquartered in Irving, Texas), Tesoro (in San Antonio, TX), and Unocal 
(El Segundo, California) complained that AK "workers" weren't sufficiently 
educated--passed a  law  mandating  that its 
students 
pass an exit exam to receive a  high school diploma.

<P><CENTER><TABLE width="80%"><TR><TD><P ALIGN=LEFT>
... two years earlier,   <a 
href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/profile.asp?state=AK">30</a>% 
  of AK's 8th graders--compared to  <a 
href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/profile.asp?state=TX"> 
21</a>% of TX's and <a 
href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/profile.asp?state=CA">17</a>% 
 of CA's--scored   "proficient" on the National Assessment of Educational 
Progress' math test, the closest the U.S. had  to a "gold standard." Why 
didn't that leg notice that AK students were scoring higher than those  in 
the home states of the whining oil execs?   Provincialism?  Perhaps--but 
the opinions of business [heretofore usually men] have influenced U.S. 
public education since its inception (Callahan, 1962; Cremin, 1961; Nasaw, 
1979; Wise,  1979).

And there's also the apocryphal tale of the   space mission run awry 
because one set of engineers was using metric while  another wasn't (Mars 
Orbiter,  1998).

On the other hand,  I once read--don't know if it's true--that   early 
20th century Turkey switched from Arabic to Roman numerals (if it did, it 
probably didn't take much <font color="blue" >XVII   &#215;   
MDCLXI  &#247; DM</font>ing to switch back).

<LI>
In the present century, Virginia  mandated  

that  its statewide test results  account for students who had earlier 
failed but, after   remedial work,  passed--by adding their scores to the 
numerator of its overall  passing rate but not their number to its 
denominator (inexorably inflating it, theoretically to  over 100%) ...

Partly in response to   what the preceding implies about 
where the scores of state legislators   would fall within a gaussian or 
"bell curve" distribution of standardized math test scores,  there's 
a new national education law, which I'm embarrassed to say, 
<i>mandates</i>   
that <I>all</i> students score "proficient" in math within a dozen 
years--irrationally assuming no student (<a 
href="http://www.nclb.gov">0%</a>) anywhere will accidentally be off a 
column on a bubble sheet or deliberately  boycott,  embarrassed by and 
rebelling against an uncle sam.

Was  the U.S. invasion of  Iraq the triumph of ideology or stupidity?  
Ignoring the ethical issues screaming from the invasion and ensuing 
"reconstruction"--which is impossible--what went wrong? 

Is it fascism or a dimwittedness? One forthcoming article suggests that 
that some involved with    post-tsunami reconstruction are working to 
dispossess those left who lived on the coasts with hotels for tourists and 
commercial fish farms. This is an awesomely stupid combination (what 
tourist would want to go swimming in    fish farm waste?).  The greed is 
not surprising--"every need's got an ego to feed" (Bob Marley). Also not 
surprising is the   dearth of human empathy and compassion ("I'm so glad it 
happened," etc.). What  surprises me is the stupidity of the plan: tourists 
will notice that going for a swim is followed by coming out lice infested 
(based on studies of salmon fry whose migratory paths cross  commercial 
fish farms--research sponsored by wild fishing industry). As to the media,  
I quit watching TV on hearing CNN's trenchant comment on sodamned hussein's 
initial change of venue: "he's lost weight" (web sites that start off on an 
ad hoc basis like blackboxvoting.org and buzzflash.com show that the 
internet provides sometimes the only alternative to information pollution, 
the ever rising kipple tide--which is not to say it's not mostly crap).  
What is going wrong?

Another great example comes from a 2003 Alaska Justice Center sexual 
assault study: its 
  <a 
href="http://www.claudiax.net/GIFFERS/ajct10.gif" target="_new">Table 
10</a> showed self-reports of "substance" use prior to assault (yes, no) 
crosstabulated by self-reports of whether  substance use  was purposeful 
(yes, no): Over 75% of those reporting they'd consumed alcohol--legal at 
the time the data were collected--reported they had done so deliberately 
while only 15% of those reporting they'd smoked marijuana--illegal at the 
time the data were collected--reported doing it on purpose: the one 
substance being legal and the other not at the time of data collection  is 
the likely explanation of that particular   criminal justice statistic. 
Those making the decisions are obviously an elite--equally obviously not a 
cognitive elite.

  Everyone's inner ethnostatistician is piqued by reading   that 
  more and more Americans are engaging in unsafe low carb high fat diets 
  while more and more medical associations are warning against them (that 
  the warnings by and large are  available by subscription only is probably 
  just   a byproduct of copyright law). Lack of access to knowledge 
  cannot though explain public spectacles like the U.S. Secretary of Education 
  writing a  letter to the Utah state legislature comparing results from 
  two different achievement tests whose definitions of proficiency are of unknown relationship to 
  each other (but expected to be different, 4/11/05).
 Yet another example was the state of Alaska's  Attorney General: he  resigned 
 2/05, because someone had noticed he was   promoting, to the Taiwanese,  a coal 
  cleaning technology in which he had significant shares from his dais as 
  AG while on the public dime (and then having, in his words, 
  "accidentally"  erased emails pertaining to his portfolio upon learning 
  that he was under investigation); before resigning, he "reasoned" that the governor  
  anointing his daughter U.S. senator--a very succinct example of that 
  inbreeding problem--was OK because sovereignty resided in the  
  legislature,  something to do with the 17th Amendment for which 
  he could find no citations (one would not accept such work from  
  students; why accept them from adults like   state attorneys general?). The examples, 
  at least in the U.S., are seemingly endless. Questions about who is 
  making the bad decisions are publicly answered only by creating scapegoats then	 stuffed into the gaping decision making holes.  As 
  to the future, the only thing the first generations of students tested 
  annually to produce "accountability" scores are certain to have instilled 
  in them   is the ability to follow directions or orders.

We may conclude--or not--that the preponderance of evidence establishes  a 
link between the variables in question (average standardized math test  
scores  and the AFQT) and their purported construct, <I><B><font color="navy">intelligence</font></b>.</i>

Were  we to so conclude, we'd interpret Americans having lower 
standardized 
math test scores  to mean that Americans are less <I><B><font 
color="navy">intelligent</font></b></i> than their peers (and  were we not to so 
conclude,  there's still the embarrassing <I>fact</i> that Americans do 
have lower test scores and a documented history of doing <I>dumb things 
with numbers).</I>

</ul>
<P>                                           

But, again, to conclude that Americans are less <I><B><font color="navy">intelligent</font></b></i>   than other humans, we'd need to 
establish, were we being rational, that standardized math test scores were 
a good measure of <I><B><font color="navy">intelligence</font></b></i> (and dismiss 
repeated instances of doing  <I>dumb things with numbers</I> as  
pathological) ...  As with discussions of "nationality"  and <I><B><font color="navy">intelligence</font></b>,</i> so with discussions of   "ethnicity"   
and <I><B><font color="navy">intelligence</font></b>:</i> a link between the variable 
and the construct of interest must be established before interpreting one 
as an indicator of the other. This web page isn't about that debate. It's 
an empirical examination of a statistical analysis published in <U>The 
Bell 
Curve</u>, the first one.

Examining the impact of 
Kant's writings on all subsequent thinkers--including Kuhn, 1962, to whom 
all research experience-in-the-world is but a footnote--illustrates the 
"peer review" process.
Kant credited Hume for awakening him 
--he'd been full prof for a decade--from his "dogmatic 
slumbers:" Kant  synthesized Leibniz's rationalism and Newton's empiricism 
by 
placing the INDIVIDUAL human knower at the center of all knowledge.  He
outlined a model whereby a knowing mind might construe a world, arguing 
that understanding is a product of our perceptions and "reason" working 
together: The mind experiences nothing 
without perceptions--and has nothing to think about without "reason." In 
the preface to the second edition of his first <U>Critique</U>, Kant noted 
that "Reason approaches nature ...  to be taught by it  ... not in the 
character of a pupil who listens to everything that the teacher chooses to 
say, but of an appointed judge who compels the witnesses to answer 
questions which he has himself formulated ... (p. 20)."
<P>

<CENTER><TABLE width="80%"><TR><TD><P ALIGN=LEFT>
He <I>agreed</I> with the rationalists that what is known through the 
senses is merely appearance and  that reason plays a critical role in the 
knowledge chain--a point on which  he <I>disagreed</I> with the 
empiricists,  with whom he <I>agreed</I>  that human knowledge is grounded 
in the perceptions of our physical senses   and  that the physical 
world--"the thing-in-itself"--is  unknowable in the sense of
unprovable (the problem of induction).

<P>Kant separated "knowledge" from "belief," and "opinion:" the first 
requiring 
both objective and subjective certainty; the second,   subjective 
certainty, and the third, neither. In so doing, his "critical philosophy" 
separated science and religion and placed ethics beyond revelation, 
convention, and outside authority.
</td></tr></table></center><P>

Prominent rationalist and empiricist  academic journal  "peer reviews" 
of Kant's <U>Critique of Pure Reason</U> (1787) were scathing--several 
university towns banning his book as "subversive" ...  But in less than a 
decade--it took just months for  researchers  to discredit "cold fusion" 
by 
communicating on USENET    their many unsuccessful  attempts to  replicate 
P &amp; F's results in their  own labs--Kant's "critical philosophy"--what 
Palmquist (1996) called his "Copernican turn"--was taught throughout his 
area: students and recruiters from rival universities flocked to him, and  
some regarded him as a seer on matters irrelevant. As far as the latter, 
there are always those who set the bar of explanatory relevance  so low 
that they believe in astrology, etc. As far as the former,

Kant's peers  had 
not been targeted and befuddled by  advertising campaigns; no  opinion 
polls had been taken; it wasn't because he was employed by the University 
of  K&ouml;ningsberg or because enron or u-haul math had occurred--and 
there are no questions of authenticity or verisimilitude;  nothing magical 
or celestial   happened: Kant's "peers" came to agree with him--"free 
will"?--because they thought him correct. In the centuries since--whether
quantitatively measured in MB or qualitatively reflected in 
text  like the title of one of Karatani's essays "On the Thing-in-Itself"
and Heidegger's term <I>"being-in-the-world"</i>--
more  has been written 
 about 
him   than  he wrote.

  The insight of his <U>Critique</u>s--yes, three: Kant spoke for human 
 equality: revolutions in America and France could not have escaped his 
 notice--is that the everyday world consists of what experience is like as 
 it  happens, whether  the experience is of someone conducting a 
 statistical analysis or someone deciding which  cabbage to pick. The 
 corollary is that the reality we perceive is the only reality of which we 
 can speak with certainty.

<h2>Center for Sociocybernetics Studies Bonn  <a href="index_de.html"><img

style="border:none" /> </a></h2>

<p>
The <i>Center for Sociocybernetics Studies Bonn</i> was founded 2008,
and grew out of the <a href="http://www.iais.fraunhofer.de">
Fraunhofer Institut für Intelligente Analyse- und Informationssysteme
(IAIS)</a>. It is part of the <a href="http://www.wissenskulturen.de">
Association "Cultures of Knowledge" ("Wissenskulturen e.V.").</a> The
research focus of the center is the application of systems thinking
and cybernetic principles in order to analyse and handle social
phenomena regarding their <em>complexity</em> and <em>dynamics.</em>
The following aspects can be emphasised that may be seen as
characteristic of our research approach:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Systems:</b> Research interest focused on handling
complexity.  A systemic view is an observation attempting to trace the
diversity of interaction in reality instead of analytically isolating
individual causal relations and exploring them in their entire
depth. Systems are defined by a certain form of distinction from their
environment. </li>

	<li> <b>Processuality:</b> Cybernetics "treats not things but
ways of behaving.  It does not ask 'What is a thing?’ but ‘What does
it do?'" (Ashby 1956). It is not the nature, the properties, the
materiality of objects that forms the centre of its interest but their
forms of operation. </li>

	<li> <b>Reciprocity:</b> It is not causality but the mutual
influence of dynamic self-regulating systems that research focuses
on. With a cybernetic approach, one has opted for the examination of
the basic forms from which the internal order of a system results
rather than for observing individual properties.</li>

	<li> <b>Self-referentiality: </b> To Heinz von Foerster, this
is the fundamental principle of cybernetic thought. He speaks of
"circularity", referring to all concepts that can be applied on
themselves, processes in which a state ultimately reproduces
itself. (v. Foerster 1993, p. 73).  Luhmann adopts this concept under
the headword "self-referentiality".</li>

	<li> <b>Information:</b> System processes, especially the
relation between the system and the environment, are understood as
"informational processes" in which contingencies exist and selection
occurs rather than as necessities in the sense of a strict causality.
Information is often referred to as a function of the organisation of
systems. Some natural scientists regard information as a "third
factor" next to matter and consciousness (Weizsäcker 1974) or matter
and energy (Stonier 990).</li>

	<li><b>Regulation: </b>The purposeful influencing of social
phenomena always amounts to an attempt to intervene in highly complex
systems with self-organising (dissipative) structures. These systems
respond to attempts to regulate them coming from their environment
only on the basis of their internal structure. Thus regulation has to
handle the phenomenon of the determinedness of systems’
structures.</li>

</ul>
