<font size=5>FOREWORD</font> <br>

<p>This is the third guide in the series Teaching the History of Science: Resources and Strategies, published under the auspices of the Committee on Education by the History of Science Society. These guides, written by specialists, are intended for the use of historians of science as well as general historians and any other teachers who wish to begin to revise a history of science course or to incorporate new topics into an existing course. The guides will be published in the Newsletter first, then as a pamphlet.<br>

<p>The first guide, <i>The Scientific Revolution</i>, appeared in the July 1986 issue of the Newsletter; the second, <i>Science, Technology, and Public Policy</i>, in the April 1987 issue. The editorial board for each guide is drawn from the Society's Committee on Education. The committee welcomes comments on the value of these guides, as well as on suggested topics for future guides.<br>

<p><font size =5>INTRODUCTION</font><br> 
<p>In recent years, scholarly work in the history of twentieth-century life science has increased dramatically. This development represents a break in two traditions within the field of history of science: first, from the dominating influence of the history of the physical sciences and mathematics; and second, from the focus on the period before the twentieth century.<br>

<p>Over many years of teaching I have found that the history of twentieth-century biology has a special interest for both graduate and undergraduate students from a wide variety of backgrounds. Students whose primary interest lies in the sciences (especially the biomedical sciences) find that they come to view current biological problems in a new perspective when they are familiar with their historical and philosophical background. Students whose primary focus is history and the social sciences have often found themselves more interested in science, especially the more generally accessible life sciences, when viewed in a historical, philosophical, or sociopolitical context. This guide provides an introductory bibliography for teachers at the college and university level who wish to include topics in the history of twentieth-centtury life science in courses ranging from biology proper to social and intellectual history, as well as in courses in the history of science itself.<br>

<p>The guide is restricted to the life, or biological, sciences and excludes medicine and health policy.  While the main focus will be on the history, as opposed to the philosophy, of the life sciences, some philosophical issues will necessarily be included. The major trends I have chosen--heredity, development, evolution, physiology, ecology, and animal behavior--are those that have commanded the most attention from biologists themselves in this century. The final topic--the relation of biology to social and political issues--is an area that has increasingly become of interest to historians and sociologists of science, as well as to a growing number of biologists themselves.<br>

<p> <font size=5>GENERAL SOURCES</font> 
<p>To understand the major developments within twentieth-century life science it is important to know something about its nineteenth-century background.<br>

<p>A particularly significant field is that of morphology, especially from the 1870s on. The mainstays of morphology were such disciplines as comparative anatomy, systematics, paleontology, and embryoloay, all aimed in one way or another at elucidating phylogenetic (evolutionary) history. It was a method of investigation--largely descriptive and often speculative--as much as a set of conclusions.  One instructive study is Jane Maienschein's "Cell Lineage, Ancestral Reminiscence, and the Biogenetic Law," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1978, 11:129-158, which discusses the influence of Ernst Haeckel and other morphologists on several key twentieth- century biologists. A history of the general relationship (one would say subservience) of embryology to evolution can be found in Stephen Jay Gould's <i>Ontogeny and Phylogeny</i>(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1977), a stimulating book treating both history and contemporary theory (as so rarely happens) within the same volume. A nineteenth-century encyclopedia entry, Patrick Geddes's "Morphology," <i>Britannica</i> (9th ed., London, 1883), Vol. XVI, pp. 837-846, provides a thumb-nail portrait of morphology as it was understood in its heyday.<br>

<p>Two short papers provide additional general perspectives on developments in biological theory during the nineteenth century. J. W. Wilson's "Biology Attains Maturity in the Nineteenth Century," in <i>Critical Problems in the History of Science</i>, edited by Marshall Clagett (Madison: Univ. Wisconsin Press, 1959), pp. 401-408, emphasizes particularly the roles of cell and protoplasm theory as organizing principles of mid- and late nineteenth-century biology. Paul Farber's discussion paper "The Transformation of Natural History in the Nineteenth Century," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1982, 15:145-152, argues that natural history became more analytical and causal in the nineteenth century, seeking explanations rather than remaining content with cataloguing and description.<br>

<p> The only readily available work to deal exclusively with the twentieth century is Garland E. Allen's <i>Life Science in the Twentieth Century</i> (New York: Wiley, 1975; Cambridge Univ. Press, 1978). While not attempting to cover all topics, this book has chapters on the nineteenth-century background and on heredity, evolution, embryology, molecular biology, and general physiology. An extensive bibliographical essay surveys the pre-1978 literature in the field. The book is based on the theme that the life sciences in the twentieth century broke from the descriptive and speculative tradition that had dominated much of late nineteenth-century biology. Allen's thesis has been challenged in a provocative series of essays by Jane Maienschein, Ron Rainger, and Keith Benson, published with the author's own response and an evaluation of the discussion by Frederick B. Churchill, in <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1981, 14:83- 191.<br>

<p> Jane Maienschein surveys a number of major works in the history of twentieth-century life science in America in "History of Biology," <i>Osiris</i> 1985, N.S., 1:147-162.  Although devoted to American biology, Maienschein's essay is particularly valuable since it focuses on a number of current historiographical issues.<br>

<p>In such a fast-moving field as the history of twentieth-century biology periodical literature serves as a valuable teaching resource. Numerous pertinent articles may be found in <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, <i>Mendel Newsletter</i>, <i>Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences</i>, and <i>Bulletin of the History of Medicine</i>. The now-defunct <i>Studies in History of Biology</i> (Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1977-1984) was devoted to longer essays in the history of biology and focused on the twentieth century. Two journals that intermix history and philosophy of biology particularly well are <i>History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences</i> (Stazione Zoologica, Naples) and the newly launched (Spring 1986) <i>Biology and Philosophy.</i><br>

<p><font size=5> EXPERIMENTAL EMBRYOLOGY</font> 
<p>By the late nineteenth century various biologists began to seek ways of incorporating more experimental methods and causal explanation into what had been basically a descriptive science. This trend was initially most prominent in embryology (developmental biology, in today's terms), but it soon spread to other fields such as heredity, evolution, and, ultimately, ecology, and animal behavior.<br>

<p>A useful collection of contemporary reviews papers discussing the state of embryological and morphological work in the 1890s comes from the Marine Biological Laboratory's famous Friday evening lecture  series (1889-1899). Selected papers from  this series have been reprinted with commentary by Jane Maienschein as <i>Defining Biology: Lectures from the 1890s</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1986).  This collection provides easy access to some authoritative but not overly technical primary source material that could easily  be assigned to undergraduate students.<br>

<p>Secondary material on Wilhelm Roux, Hans Driesch, and early experimentation is  not as plentiful as the subject demands. A  brief and highly informative history of the  idea of experimentation on embryos is  Frederick Churchill's "Chabry, Roux, and  the Experimental Method in Nineteenth- Century Embryology," in <i>Foundations of Scientific Method</i>, edited by Ronald Giere and Richard S. Westfall (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1973), pp. 161-205. A significant issue in the Roux-Driesch controversy was the old seventeenth- and eighteenth-century debate over epigenesis and preformation--whether the embryo develops by organizing less-formed material into the structure of embryonic parts (epigenesis) or merely grows in size from an already-formed, miniature adult (preforma tion). An informative and insightful study of that controversy, from Roux and Driesch to twentieth-century figures such as C. O.  Whitman, E. B. Wilson, and E. G. Conklin, is  Maienschein's "Preformation or New Formation--or Neither or Both?" in <i>A History ofEmbryology</i>, edited by T.J. Herder, J. A.  Witkowski, and C.C. Wylie (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986), pp. 73-108. The Roux-Driesch debate is clear and straightforward, and easily accessible to almost all students.<br>

<p> Jane Oppenheimer's <i>Essays in the History of Embryology and Biology</i> (Cam- bridge: MIT Press, 1967) contains number of valuable contributions, most of which deal with early or mid-twentieth- century embryology. Viktor Hamburger's essay "Embryology," in <i>The Evolutionary Synthesis</i>, edited by Emst Mayr and William Provine (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1980), pp. 96-112, provides an excellent overview of the growth of the whole field of embryology in the twentieth century.<br>

<p>Among the most significant developments in experimental embryology are those of Hans Spemann (1869-1941) and his school at Freiburg between 1900 and 1933. Despite his eminence and his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1935, Spemann has enjoyed little attention from historians. Viktor Hamburger has written severaf essays on this school, of which he was a preeminent graduate, with special reference to the most important concept to emerge from their work, the "organizer theory." A general perspective is given in "Hans Spemann and the 'Organizer Concept,' " <i>Experientia</i> 1969, 25:1121-1125. A more recent essay by Hamburger details the work of one of Spemann's most notable women students and her role in discovering the organizer concept: "Hilde Mangold, Co-discoverer of the Organizer,Ó <i>Joumal of the History of Biology</i>, 1984, 7:1-11. Hamburger has also prepared a  book-length monograph on the Spemann school: <i>The Heritage of Experimental Embryology: Hans Spemann and the Organizer</i> (Oxford Univ. Press, 1988).<br>     

<p>Kenneth R. Manning's <i>Black Apollo of Science: The Life of Emest Everett Just</i> (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1983) is probably closer to institutional and social history than to history of embryology per se, yet Manning's biography of one of America's few prominent black scientists includes discussion ofJust's various studies on fertilization, early embryonic development, and the properties of the cell surface. It also includes a great deal of information on racism in science, the problems of funding scientific research, hiring practices in American universities, black education, work in research institutions such as the Marine Biological Laboratory, and the relationship between the American and European scientific (largely, of course, biological) communities in the period 1920- 1940. <i>Black Apollo</i> can thus serve as a useful introduction to many aspects of the social history of American biology. <br>

<p><font size=5> HEREDITY (GENETICS) </font> 
<p> Because of the central position that genetics has come to occupy in twentieth-century biology, its history has been more  fully documented than that of fields such as embryology. A recent and general source for views on the history of heredity is Emst Mayr's massive <i>The Growth of Biological Thought</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ.  Press, 1982), especially Part II (Chs.  14-19). A useful introduction to the secondary literature is Mayr's essay review: "The Recent Historiography of Genetics," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1973, 6:125-154. The most general and in some ways most complete source of ideas on heredity from the Greeks through the nineteenth century is F. J, Cole's <i>Early Theories of Sexual Generation</i> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1930). It does not treat the period after the rediscovery of Mendel in 1900, and it represents an older form of scholarship that is more descriptive than analyt ical. Yet it contains a wealth of information     arranged chronologically. A more recent (and still available) general history is Hans Stubbe's <i>History of Genetics</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1972). Less comprehensive but more pertinent to those with an interest in the twentieth century are L. C. Dunn, <i>A Short History of Genetics</i> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965), and A. H. Sturtevant, <i>A History of Genetics</i> (New York: Harper & Row, 1965). Both focus on the period since the rediscovery of Mendel and are what would today be called highly "internalist" histories (that is, focusing on the history of the scientific ideas apart from their broader social and historical context). In the same vein, but more detailed  about the actual genetics, is Elof A. Carlson's <i>The Gene: A Critical History</i> (Philadelphia: Saunders, 1966). All three books have useful bibliographies of primary (mostly published) materials, with Carlson's being the most extensive.<br>

<p>A good deal of scholarly work exists on the life and work of Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), most of it pertinent to the history of twentieth-century genetics. Despite its age, Hugo Iltis's <i>Life of Mendel</i>(New York: Norton, 1932) is still a standard source. A more recent, broader work is by the historian of science Robert C. Olby.  <i>In The Origins of Mendelism</i> (New York: Schocken Books, 1966), Olby summarizes much of the nineteenth-century work leading up to Mendel and analyzes Mendel's own work in this context. Vitezslav Orel's brief biography, <i>Mendel</i> translated by Stephen Finn (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1984) focuses on Mendel's work, but it is especially useful in describing the scientific, cultural, and agricultural milieu in Moravia at the time Mendel lived.<br>

<p> Mendel's actual work, including the "problem" of his rediscovery,isthesubject of numerous writings. One of the most accessible is Curt Stern and Eva Sherwood's <i>The Origin of Genetics: A Mendel Source Book</i> (San Francisco: Freeman, 1966). This book is particularly useful for students, since it contains reprints of a number of important papers by Hugo de Vries and RA. Fisher.<br>

<p> The historical problem of Mendel's long neglect (thirty-five years from the publication of his paper on hybridization in 1866 until its rediscovery by Carl Correns, Erich Tschermak, and de Vries) has been the subject of many scholarly inquiries. Most of the arguments are summarized in Olby's <i>Origins</i> and Mayr's <i>Growth</i>.  Robert Olby also published a challenging essay: "Mendel No Mendelian? " <i>History of Science</i>, 1979, 17:53--72. Olby's point is that much of    what we call "Mendelian" today was not a part of Mendel's original conception and can be claimed to be so only if we read the ideas back into his work. Augustine Brannigan in "The Reification of Mendel," <i>Social Studies of Science</i>, 1979, 9:423-454, argues that Mendel's main interest in hybridization lay in the light it could throw on the species problem, an issue that was less important to his contemporaries than the practical questions of animal and plant breeding. By 1900, Brannigan suggests, the species question had become of greater interest to the biological community, and hence there was a more favorable atmosphere for understanding and accepting Mendel's main argument.<br>

<p>Prior to the rediscovery of Mendel's work, Francis Galton (1822-1911)had already initiated a totally different approach   to the problem of heredity: what became known as biometrics, or the measurement of traits within populations. The biometrical movement developed an extensive research program with Galton and, later, his protege Karl Pearson (1857-1936) as its leaders. A good introduction to the issues is William Provine's <i>Origins of Theoretical  Population Genetics</i> (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1971; esp. Chs. 2 and 3).<br>

<p>Historians with a more explicitly sociological point of view have since traced the origin and content of early biometrical  work to the social class interests and perspectives of its founders. Of particular interest is Donald MacKenzie's <i>Statistics in Britain, 1865-1930</i> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh Univ. Press, 1981). MacKenzie emphasizes how the development of biometrical thought was intimately connected to  social purposes such as eugenics in the work of Galton, Pearson, and R. A. Fuher.<br>

<p>The course of the debate between biometricians and Mendelians makes an important case study of the role of methodology in science. The controversy is the subject of the chapters in Provine's <i>Origins</i> and of two interesting papers: Lyndsay Farrell, "Controversy and Conflict in Science: The English Biometric School and Mendel's Laws," <i>Social Studies of Science</i>, 1975, 5:269-301; and Donald MacKenzie and Barry Barnes, "Scientific Judgment: The Biometry-Mendelian Controversy," in <i>Natural Order: Historical Studies of Scientific Culture</i>, edited by Barry Barnes and Steven Shapin (Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage, 1979), pp. 191-210.<br>

<p>An important aspect of the history of Mendelian theory in the twentieth century has been the field of cytology--the study of cell structure and function. Most important for heredity, of course, is study of the cell nucleus, in particular the chromesomes. There was considerable debate in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries on the function of the chromesomes and the significance of the events surrounding mitosis and meiosis. A detailed and extensive analysis is Hermann J. Muller's introduction to the reprint edition of E. B. Wilson's <i>The Cell in Development and Inheritance</i> (New York: Johnson Reprint, 1966). Another comprehensive  study is William Coleman's "Cell, Nucleus and Inheritance: An Historical Study," <i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</i>, 1965, 109:124-158, which moves chronologically from Darwin's pangenesis (his provisional speculations about hereditary units) to the more empirical work of August Weismann (1834-1937), to the discovery of nuclein, or DNA. This is a marvelous survey presented with a keen historian's eye.<br>

<p>The so-called classical school of genetics arose after 1910 and is best characterized as the synthesis of Mendelian breeding experiments with cytological studies of chromosome structure and behavior. This work developed chiefly in the United States, though major contributions came from England, Germany, and Scandinavia. Several books deal wholly or in part with this period and can be used as a basic entry into the wider literature of twentieth-century genetics. Dunn (<i>A Short History</i>) and Sturtevant (<i>A History</i>) were both prominent practitioners of classical genetics, and it is not surprising that their histories concentrate heavily on the classical period.   

Carlson also focuses on that period in <i>The Gene</i>. Several biographies provide a good introduction to the basic developments.  Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945) is  considered to be one of the major architects of the chromosome theory of heredity.  His life and work is the subject of two biographies.  <p>

<p>With mutation, one of the most influential concepts put forward in twentieth-century genetics was the distinction between genotype and phenotype, first enunciated  by the Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen  (1857-1927) in 1909. His work has been  admirably discussed by Frederick Churchill in "Wilhelm Johannsen and the Genotype Concept," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1974, 7:5-30.<br>

<p>In addition to some skepticism about the  importance of chromosomes, another  stumbling block to the acceptance of Mendelian theory emerged in the 1920s and  the 1930s: the concept of cytoplasmic inheritance. Cytoplasmic inheritance refers to the possibility that some traits are transmitted from parent (usually mother) to offspring through the egg cytoplasm rather  than through the nucleus. Cytoplasmic inheritance and the opposition it met from classical geneticists are beautifully laid out in Jan Sapp's "The Struggle for Authority in   the Field of Heredity, 1900-1932: New Perspectives on the Rise of Genetics," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1983,  16:311-342. This article is a particularly fine integration of technical, sociological, and intellectual history. Complementing  Sapp's study is a recent paper by Jonathan Harwood, "The Reception of Morgan's  Chromosome Theory in Germany: Inter-war Debate over Cytoplasmic Inheritance," <i>Medizinhistorisches Journal</i>, 1984, 19:3-32, which describes the mixed reception Morgan's chromosome work received in Germany owing to the prevailing views there (and elsewhere in Europe) on the role the cytoplasm might play in heredity.   Sapp's more recent book, <i>Beyond the Gene</i> (Oxford Univ. Press, 1987), spells the story in more depth than his earlier article.<br>

<p>The history of human genetics has been the focus of only a few writings, despite its obvious-importance and interest. Three of these deserve special mention: Charles E. Rosenberg, "Charles B. Davenport and the Beginnings of Human Genetics," <i>Bulletin of the History of Medicine</i>, 1961, 35 (3): 266-276; Curt Stern, "Mendel and Human Genetics," <i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</i>, 1965, 109 (4): 216-226; and, for post-1930s developments, the later chapters of Daniel J. Kevles, <i>In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity</i> (New York: Knopf, 1985).<br>

<p>The relationship between genetics and embryology in the twentieth century presents a curious mixture of integration and fragmentation. The overall history has been told by Viktor Hamburger in Mayr and Provine's <i>The Evolutionary Synthesis</i>, pp. 97-111. More recent is Scott Gilbert's insightful essay "The Embryological Origins of the Gene Theory," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1978, 11:307-351, which traces the development of the gene theory to embryological concerns with the  problems of differentiation and control.  The philosophical roots of the split between genetics and embryology after about  1915 are explored in Garland E. Allen, "T. H. Morgan and the Split Between Embryology and Genetics, 1910-1935," in <i>History of Embryology</i>, ed. Herder et al, pp.113-144 (see Section 2 above).<br>

<p>Historical explication of the socioeconomic (agricultural) context of the origin of genetics has had a slow but increasingly  promising start. One important proponent of this interpretation, Vitezslav Orel, Director of the Mendelianum of the Moravian  Museum in Brno, has traced such interest  in the work of Mendel himself. Orel's short  paper "Interest in Hybridization in Moravia before Mendel Came to Brno," <i>Journal of Heredity</i>, 1973, 64(1), suggests a far closer  relationship between Mendel's interest in  genetic transmission (as we call it today) and the problems of agricultural productivity than has been recognized before. See also V. Orel and R.J. Wood, "The Sheep Breeders' Legacy to Gregor Mendel," in <i>Gregor Mendel and the Foundation of Genetics</i>, edited by Orel and Anna Matalova (Brno: Mendelianum/Czechoslovak Society for the History of Science, 1983), pp. 57-75.<br>

<p>Several essays by Charles Rosenberg have suggested the importance in America of agriculture to the growth of genetics in the twentieth century.  One of the few historians to follow Rosenberg's lead has been Barbara Kimmelman, whose article "The American Breeders' Association: Genetics and Eugenics in an Agricultural Context, 1903-1913," <i>Social Studies of Science</i>, 1983, 13:163-204, shows clearly the importance many agriculturalists saw in Mendel's work.  A far more radical, overtly economic analysis can be found in R. C. Lewontin and Jean-Pierre Bertan, "Technology, Research, and the Penetration of Capltal: The Case of U.S. Agriculture," <i>Monthly Review</i>, 1986, 38:21-34; and Bertan and Lewontin, "The Political Economy of Hybrid Corn," <i>Monthly Review</i>, 1986, 38:35-47. Both articles are clearly presented and provocative.<br>

<p><font size=5>EVOLUTIONARY THEORY</font> 
<p>The checkered career of Darwinian theory in the twentieth century provides insights into both the history of ideas and the actual problems inherent in the content of evolutionary theory itself. I have found teaching the history of evolutionary thought, from before Darwin through the present day (or at least up through the period of synthesis in the 1930s), an exciting and rewarding classroom experience.<br>

<p>The most general and up-to-date source covering the breadth of evolutionary theory is Peter Bowler's <i>Evolution: The History of an Idea</i> (Berkeley: Univ. California Press, 1984). Bowler includes interesting chapters on the social implications of evolutionary theory (these cover Social  Darwinism, eugenics, and race movements  of the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries), as well as on the modern debates (neo-Lamarckism, punctuated equilibrium, and creationism). This is a useful book.  Equally valuable for its sweep, but more comprehensive than Bowler, is Ernst Mayr's <i>Growth</i>, Part II.  Chapters 7-13 deal explicitly with evolutionary theory in the period from the Enlightenment to the  present. As a participant in the synthesis of the 1940s and 1950s himself, Mayr writes from a special perspective, but his knowledge of the field, especially systematics and its integration into evolutionary theory, is prodigious.  Both Bowler and Mayr have extensive bibliographies of the primary and secondary literature. Mayr's book is less useful to students than Bowler's paperback, which serves well as a textbook.<br>

<p>A number of varied sources are available on more specialized topics within twentieth-century evolutionary theory. Stephen Jay Gould's essays from <i>Natural History</i> often deal with historical aspects of evolution, paleontoiogy, and systematics. Many of the best of these have been collected into three paperback volumes: <i>Ever Since Darwin</i> (New York: Norton, 1977), The Panda's Thumb</i> (New York: 1980), and <i>Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes</i> (New York: Norton, 1983), Selected wisely for class use, these articles can be captivating; they are also good history.  They are however, episodic, making it difficult to trace development or continuity.<br>

<p>The ill repute into which Darwinian theory had fallen by 1900 is chronicled in recent through study by Peter Bowler, <i>The Eclipse of Darwinism</i> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1983).  The teacher interested in reading contemporaries' own accounts of their views on Darwin should see Vernon L. Kellogg's <i>Darwinism Today</i> (New York: Holt, 1907), a masterful summary with extensive excerpts from original sources.<br>

<p> The evolutionary synthesis itself has been the subject of a number of recent articles and monographs. The best overall introduction is Provine's <i>Origins</i>, which focuses particularly on the work of R.A. Fisher (1890-1962), J.B.S. Haldane (1892-1969), and Sewall Wright (1889-1988). Although it does not deal much with the social or historical context, Provine's book is concise, straightforward, and eminently clear.  Mayr's <i>Growth</i> devotes one chapter (l2) to the "synthesis" proper, and another (l3) to "post-synthesis developments."  These chapters serve as a useful introduction, though, as always, events are seen from Mayr's particular perspective as one of the "synthesizers."  A more detailed and varied set of interpretations can be found in Mayr and Provine's <i>Evolutionary Synthesis</i>.  An interesting collection of papers can be found in a volume edited by Marjorie Grene, <i>Dimensions of Darwinism: Themes and Counter Themes in Twentieth-Century Evolutionary Theory</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1983).  An important though not-much-discussed contribution to the development of evolutionary theory came from the Russian school of population genetics in the 1920s and 1930s, spearheaded by Sergei S. Chetverikov (1880-1959).  Two articles by Mark B. Adams detail clearly and elegantly the developments in Russian natural history and population genetics that were eventually to be carried to the West by Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1979): "The Founding of Population Genetics: Contributions of the Chetverikov School, 1924- 1934," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1968, 1:23-39; and "Towards a Synthesis: Population Concepts in Russian Evolutionary Thought: 1925-1935," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1970, 3:107-129.<br>

<p>With regard to individual figures important in the synthesis, two are subjects of recent significant biographies.  Joan Fisher Box's <i>R. A. Fisher: The Life of a Scientist</i>(New York: Wiley, 1978) provides a lively and candid portrait of her father as a mathematician driven to biology by his social, eugenical concerns. William Provine's <i>Sewall Wright and Evolutionary Biology</i> (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1986) is definitive in delineating Wright's important, but largely unsung, contributions to modern population genetics. Provine has also written a lengthy introduction to a series of collected papers by Theodosius Dobzhansky, who more than anyone else   carried out the fieldwork to complement Wright's theoretical formulations: "Origins of the Genetics of Natural Population   Series," in <i>Dobzhansky's Genetics of Natural Populations, I-XLII</i>, edited by R. C. Lewontin, John A. Moore, William Provine, and Bruce Wallace (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1981), pp. 5-83.  This essay is among the best of the few discussions available on the importance of Dobzhansky's many contributions to the development of twentieth-century evolutionary theory.<br>

<p> Though superseded by both Darwin's concept of natural selection and Weismann's concept of the continuity of the germ plasm, the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics continued to attract a certain following in the United States and  Europe (including Russia) well into the twentieth century.  A comprehensive survey of the topic is L.I. Blacher's <i>The Problem of the Inheritance of Acquired  Characteristics</i>, English translation edited by Frederick Churchill (Washington, D.C.:  Smithsonian Institution Library, 1982).  Blacher begins with Lamarck, proceeding through Darwin to the present. Perhaps in response to the Lysenko affair in the USSR in the 1940s and 1950s, the author is particularly vehement in denying the possibility of inheritance of acquired traits. Not  so, however, is the journalist turned historian of science Arthur Koestler, whose biography of the neo-lamarckian Paul Kammerer, <i>The Case of the Midwife Toad</i> (New York: Random House, 1972), is a blatant attempt to rehabilitate the neo-lamarckian idea.  Koestler is an accomplished writer, and his book makes compelling reading.  But his conclusions about the inheritance of acquired traits must be taken with a grain of salt.<br>

<p> Compared to other areas of evolutionary thought, the history of human evolution has received much less attention. Darwin's thoughts on the matter are the subject of Howard Gruber's <i>Darwin on Man</i> (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1981). John Reader's older <i>Missing Links: The Hunt for Earliest Man</i> (London: Collins, 1961) was written before the bulk of newer discoveries and hence seems outdated even in its historical perspective.  Much more current and historically illuminating is Peter Bowler's <i>Theories of Human Evolution: A Centuty of Debate, 1844-1944</i> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1986). Several papers can be used to illustrate specific aspects of the topic. For the social center of some of the early work on fossil human:  see Michael Hammond's "The Expulsion of the Neanderthals from Human Ancestry: Marcellin Boule and the Social Context of Scientific Research," <i>Social Studies of Science</i>, 1982, 12:1-36. For a particularly fascinating study of accounts of human evolution as examples of heroic narratives, see Misia Landau's "Human Evolution a Narrative," <i>American Scientist</i>, 1984, 72:161-168. As an interesting sidelight the story of the Piltdown forgery has beet told on numerous occasions, but by none so well as in Stephen Jay Could's essay "The Piltdown Conspiracy," <i>Natural History</i>, August 1980, 89:8-28, and the follow-up, "Piltdown in Letters," <i>Natural History</i>, June 1980, 90:12- 30.<br>

<p>The topic of scientific creationism and its history is treated in Section 8.<br>

<p>The area of speculation and experimentation on the origin of life provides a number of intriguing and informative case histories in the development of biology.  The broadest as well as the most readable account is John Farley's <i>The Spontaneous Generation Controversy from Descartes to Oparin</i> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ Press, 1974). This is a fascinating book highly recommended for students.<br>

<p><font size=5>BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY</font>
<p>Biochemistry interfaces with biology and chemistry and is concerned with the chemical processes that take place within living cells. Modern biochemistry developed out of and largely came to replace what in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was called physiological chemistry, which dealt more with extracellular chemistry, such as the chemistry of digestion and of body fluids. Biochemistry as such is largely, though not exclusively, a twentieth-century discipline.  Molecular biology, on the other hand, has come to mean the study of the function and the three-dimensional structure of such biologically important macromolecules as proteins and nucleic acids. Molecular biology is as much an interface of biology with physics as of biology with chemistry. In many respects biochemistry and molecular biology represent the realization of the dream of early twentieth-century mechanistic biologists, who were convinced that the most fundamental biological processes could ultimately be understood in terms of the laws of physics and chemistry. For a good general introduction to the historical traditions embodied in biochemistry and molecular biology, see Scott Gilbert's "Intellectual Traditions in the Life Sciences: Molecular Biology and Biochemistry," <i>Perspectives in Biology and Medicine</i>, 1982, 26: 151-162.<br>

<p>The history of biochemistry is a young but growing field of investigation.  Among the existing general texts are two that attempt to be systematic and cover the subect from antiquity: Henry M. Leicester's <i>Development of Biochemical Concepts from Ancient to Modern Times</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1974); and Joseph S. Fruton's <i>Molecules and Life </i>(New York: Wiley, 1972). Both are relatively straightforward accounts that present a historical framework on which more interpretative views can be hung. Perhaps more interesting reading is a collection of essays edited by Joseph Needham, <i>The Chemistry of Life: Lectures on the History of Biochemistry</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1970), which contains papers by a number of eminent biochemists and historians on various aspects of the history of biochemistry.<br>

<p>Much of the history of twentieth-century biochemistry owes its origin or stimulus to the pioneering work of a chemist turned historian, John T. Edsall, emeritus professor of biological chemistry at Harvard.  The results are summarized in Edsall and David Bearman's "Historical Records of Scientific Activity: The Survey of Sources for the History of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology," <i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</i>, 1979, 123(5):279-292.  A recent work that discusses the social context of scientific research in American biochemistry is Robert E. Kolher's <i>From Medical Chemistry to Biochemistry</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1982).  Kohler traces the shift from physiological chemistry to modern biochemistry in the light of reform in medical education and the institutionalization of academic disciplines in the period 1870-1930.<br>

<p> Some of the developments that have come to fruition in molecular biology since the 1950s originated in the area known as biochemical genetics.  While the history of biochemical genetics has not yet received the attention it deserves, some inroads have been made. Bentley Glass's older "A Century of Biochemical Genetics," <i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</i>, 1968, 109(1): 227-236, is still a good introduction for the general reader by another eminent scientist turned historian.<br>

<p>The history of the discovery of DNA has been told a number of times by writers of very different genres, from actual participants to journalists and historians of  science. Of the several books on the subject, clearly the most authoritative and  comprehensive are Robert Olby's <i>The Path to the Double Helix</i> (Seattle: Univ. Washington Press, 1974) and Horace Freeland Judson's <i>The Eighth Day of Creation</i> (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1979). The former is by a historian of genetics and asks the more broadly historical questions. Judson's work is of no less high quality, however, and in some areas, such as the relation of biochemistry to molecular genetics, is more complete than Olby's. Judson has done heroic service by interviewing many of the principals, and his work is liberally illustrated with candid photos that add to its human interest.<br>

<p>James D. Watson's <i>The Double Helix</i> (New York: Athenaeum, 1968) was the first book on the history of the DNA discovery.  It is a relatively brief work and reads like a detective story, but as history it has to be taken with a grain of salt.  Of particular interest in the DNA story is the work of Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958), the brilliant X-ray crystallographer at Kings College, London, whose studies were of critical importance to Watson and Francis Crick in providing precise data on interatomic distances within the DNA molecule. Anne Sayre's <i>Rosalind Franklin and DNA</i> (New York: Norton, 1975) is a masterful essay in scientific biography. It portrays particularly well the problems that women scientists such as Franklin experienced in  trying to get and hold research positions in a field dominated (like most sciences) by men. In a similar vein, and also dealing with the history of genetics, Evelyn Fox Keller's <i>A Feeling for the Organism: The Life and Work Of Barbara McClintock</i> (San Francisco: Freeman, 1983) raises forcefully the issue of women in science and their struggle to be accepted as equals. For those who only want to dip briefly into the subject, Alfred E. Mirsky's shorter "The Discovery of DNA," <i>Scientific American</i>, June 1968, 218:78-88, presents the basic outline of events and conceptual problems. A more sociological and contextual account of the "path to the double helix" can be found in Donald Fleming's "Emigr&eacute; Physicists and the Biological Revolution," in <i>The Intellectual Migration: Europe and America, 1930-1960</i>, edited by Donald  Fleming and Bernard Bailyn (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1969). This masterful essay traces many aspects of the origins of molecular biology to the emigration of European (especially Austrian) physicists such as Max Delbriick and Erwin  Schrbdinger to England and the United States in the 1930s, with their interest in seeking new laws of physics in the study of living matter.<br>

<p>The role of the Rockefeller Foundation, under the aegis of Warren Weaver, in actually influencing the growth of molecular biology has become the subject of a lively  controversy.  An essay by Lily E. Kay, "Conceptual Models and Analytical Tools: The Biology of Physicist Max Delbr&uuml;ck," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1985, 18:207-246, challenges the notion that the field of "molecular biology" was actually created by Weaver and the Rockefeller Foundation in the 1930s.  A similar interpretation is offered by Pnina Abir-Am in "The Discourse of Physical Power and Biological Knowledge in the 1930's: A Reappraisal of the Rockefeller Foundation's 'Policy' in Molecular Biology," <i>Social Studies of Science</i>, 1982, 12:341-382. One of a younger group of sociologically oriented historians of science, Abir-Am questions the role of private philanthropy in actually creating and shaping the development of the "field" of molecular biology.  A similar point is made by Robert Kohler in "The Management of Science: The Experience of Warren Weaver and the Rockefeller Foundation Programme in Molecular Biology," <i>Minerva</i>, 1976, 14:279-306. See also Edward Yoxen, "Giving Life a New Meaning: The Rise of the Molecular Biology Establishment," in <i>Scientific Establishments and Hierarchies</i> edited by Norbert Elias, Herminio Martins, and Richard Whitley (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1982), pp.  123-143.<br>

<p>An interesting, though older and by now "classic" source is <i>Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology</i>, edited by John Cairns, Gunther Stent, and James D. Watson (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology, 1966).  A number of the essays included are historical or reminiscent in character, and indeed the volume might be viewed largely as primary source material.  For a neglected side of the story, see Seymour S. Cohen's "The Biochemical Origins of Molecular Biology (Introduction)," <i>Trends in Biochemical Sciences</i>, 1984, 9:334-336, which argues that many of the histories of molecular biology have ignored the contributions of biochemistry to molecular genetics in general and to the discovery of DNA in particular.<br>

<p>The development of molecular genetics on the heels of Mendelian genetics has raised the inevitable philosophical question of whether the discovery of DNA represents the ultimate reduction of biological to physicochemical processes. Numerous philosophers of science have approached the issue, especially the basic question of what exactly is meant by "reductionism." A useful exploration of this issue, specifically   in relation to genetics, is by Kenneth Schaffner in "Approaches to Reduction," <i>Philosophy of Science</i>, 1967, 34:137-147.  In another paper Schaffner argues that molecular biology was not built on a conscious attempt to reduce Mendelian to molecular genetics: "The Peripherality of Reductionism in the Development of Molecular Biology," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1974, 7:111-139.  On a slightly different track, David Hull maintains that molecular genetics is not logically deducible from Mendelian genetics: see "Reduction in Genetics--Biology or Philosophy?" <i>Philosophy of Science</i>, 1972, 39:491-499.  Contrary to Schaffner and Hull, William K. Goosens maintains that Mendelian genetics <i>was</i> reduced to the chemical level by molecular genetics: "Reduction by Molecular Genetics," <i>Philosophy of Science</i>, 1978, 45:73-95.  Although this topic moves from history into philosophy, students find it challenging.  Because of the centrality of molecular genetics to modern biology, it is particularly relevant to raise these philosophical questions in the context of the history of genetics.<br>

<p><font size=5> PHYSIOLOGY</font> 
<p>Despite its great importance in the growth of the biological sciences in this century, physiology has received far less attention from historians of science than is its due.  This may be in part because physiology's close historical relationship to medicine has made it seem more the province of historians of medicine.  There is also the fact that physiology underwent its revolution in methodology over a century ago, with the widespread introduction of physicochemical and experimental methods to supplement descriptive, anatomical work.  Whatever the exact reason, the result is that the reader looking for an entrance into the genneral history of twentieth-century physiology will have to consult a variety of separat, more specialized sources.<br>

<p>Rather than covering the vast array of subjects that rightfully fall under the history of physiology (such as plant physiology and pathology, etc.), I focus on three areas that have been major concerns in the twentieth century: general physiology, neurobiology and endocrinology.  For a brief introduction and overview of twentieth-century physiology, it is worthwhile to consult Karl E. Rothschuh's <i>History of Physiology</i> (Huntington, N.Y.: Krieger, 1973).  Chapter 7 (pp. 264-361) deals with the twentieth century; while it does   not provide in-depth coverage, the broad outline establishes the framework within which more specialized topics can be  placed.<br>

<p>The Prussian-born American physiologist Jacques Loeb (1859-1924), a long-time investigator at the Rockefeller Institute and a close professional friend of such figures  as T. H. Morgan, Boss Harrison, J. McKeen Cattell, and W.J. V. Osterhout, set the style of experimental and quantitative biology   that influenced a whole generation of biologists, especially in the United States.  Loeb championed what he called "the mechanistic conception of life"--the title of a major address he gave in 1911 and of a book of essays collected in 1912 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1964).  The reprint edition benefits from a superb introduction by Donald Fleming.  <i>The Mechanistic Conception of Life</i> was a celebration of the mechanistic materialist viewpoint in twentieth-century biology.  The introduction and a selection of several of the essays make for stimulating reading and are well within the reach of most undergraduates, especially those with a year or more of college biology.  A new biography of Loeb is Philip J. Pauly's <i>Controlling Life: Jacques Loeb and the Engineering Ideal in Biology</i> (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1987). As the title  suggests, Pauly emphasizes that Loeb's guiding ideal was the scientific control of life.<br>

<p> Opposition to the "mechanistic conception of life" came from a number of  sources--principally embryology and areas of general physiology--from the 1920s onward.  Prominent among those who advanced a more holistic approach were the physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon (1871-1942) and the physiological chemist Lawrence J. Henderson (1878-1942). Cannon's work, is summarized in his popular book <i>The Wisdom of the Body</i> (1932; New York: Norton, 1960), which is eminently accessible to undergraduate readers. Henderson's work is summarized, along with a number of other chemical topics, in his semipopular <i>The Fitness of the Environment</i> (1913; Boston: Beacon Press, 1958).  This paperback edition contains an introduction by George Wald. The development of the idea of homeostasis is the subject of a superb essay by Donald Fleming, "Walter B. Cannon and Homeostasis," <i>Social Research</i>, 1984, 51:609-640.<br>

<p>Henderson's work has been the subject of several studies. John Parascandola's "Organismic and Holistic Concepts in the Thought of L. J. Henderson," <i>Journal of the Histoty of Biology</i>, 1971, 4:63-113, relates Henderson's scientific to his philosophical work.  Henderson and Cannon were strongly interested in social regulation and equilibrium, as was fitting for products of the "Progressive Era," and sought in physiological processes analogies for the notion of social and economic balance. A specific discussion of Henderson's view of the interrelationship between social and physiological equilibrium theory can be found in Cynthia Eagle Russett's <i>The Concept of Equilibrium in American Social Thought</i> (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Univ. Press, 1968).  See also Stephen J. Cross and William R. Albury, "Walter B. Cannon, L.J. Henderson, and the Organic Analogy," <i>Osiris</i>, 1987, N.S. 3:165-192.<br>

<p>Endocrinology (the study of the nature and effect of hormones, or "chemical messengers," produced by the endocrine glands) is an area of general physiology that has shown enormous growth in the twentieth century.  It has also been the subject of numerous historical studies.  Arthur F. Hughes has prepared a brief but useful introduction titled "A History of Endocrinology," <i>Journal of the History of Medcine and Allied Sciences</i>, 1977, 32(3): 292-313. While it is largely descriptive  and chronological, Hughes's study demonstrates the close link between clinical pathology and the gradual discovery of the  role of hormones in maintaining physiological balance. The history of endocrinology  is the subject of a special issue of the <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1976, 9.  A general introduction to the historiography of endocrinology is provided for the volume by Diana Long Hall and Thomas F. Click (pp. 229-233). Hall has explored  some social and technical aspects of the  history of sex-hormone research in "Biology, Sex Hormones, and Sexism in the 1920s," <i>Philosophical Forum</i> 1974, 5:81-96. In this fascinating article she suggests that sexist biases about the importance of male over female hormones proved to be a barrier to the technical solution of problems associated with extracting, isolating, and characterizing the chemical nature of sex hormones (principally testosterone and estrogen) in the 1920s. On a somewhat more specific aspect of endocrinology, Michael Bliss's <i>The Discovery of Insulin</i> (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1982) provides a close picture of the technical problems that investigators in any field of endocrinology had to surmount in order to identify, isolate, and purify a given hormone. The insulin story also provides a fascinating picture of the role of drug companies in encouraging and financing hormone research in the period (1920s) before government subsidy of basic scientific research.<br>

<p>Although neurobiology (as it is now called) has always been subsumed under physiology, its rapid growth in the twentieth century, along with its institutionalization in separate university departments and separate funding programs, has made it an almost completely autonomous discipline. Neurobiology can be divided into two major areas: neurophysiology, or the study of the process by which nerve cells transmit a message; and neurology, the study of the structure and organization of the nervous system.  One of the few comprehensive historical reviews of both areas is Mary A. B. Brazier's "The Historical Development of Neurophysiology," in <i>Handbook of Physiology</i>, edited by J. Field, H. W. Magoon, and V.E. Hall (Baltimore:Waverly, 1960), Section I, Volume I, pp. 1-57.  Although this article lacks historical analysis, it does trace the history of a variety of neurophysiological problems from ancient times to the early decades of this century. Another general work, though less systematically organized than Brazier's, is <i>The Neurosciences: Paths of Discovery</i>, edited by Frederic G. Worden, Judith P. Swazey, and George Adelman (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1975).  Two articles in this collection stand out as particularly interesting: Richard Jung's "Some European Neuroscientists: A Personal Tribute" (pp. 477-511), and Judith P. Swazey and Frederic G. Worden's "On the Nature of Research in Neuroscience" (pp. 569-587).   Swazey and Worden look at the development of twentieth-century neurobiology in terms of Thomas Kuhn's concept of scientific revolution.<br>

<p>Two major questions confronted neurologists at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries: What was the basic anatomical element of the nervous system (individual cells, or a continuous nerve network)? How were parts of the nervous system (e.g., peripheral nerves and spinal cord) integrated to produce an overall functioning system? The first question involved considerable debate in the period of the 1870s through the 1890s, though it was resolved ultimately in  favor of the neuron theory (individual nerve cells as the basic structural and functional unit of the nervous system) by the early 19009.  Central to that debate was the work of the Spanish cytologist Santiago Ram&oacute;n  y Cajal (1852-1934), whose autobiography <i>Recollections of My Life</i>, translated by E. Horne Craigie with the assistance ofJuan Cano (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1937), contains considerable information about the debate, the clash of paradigms, and Ram&oacute;n y Cajal's exquisite techniques for bringing about the resolution.  A more recent and historically oriented account is Susan Billings's "Concepts of Nerve Fiber Development 1839- 1930," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1971, 4:275-306, which shows how study of the embryological development of the nervous system (which Ram&oacute;n y Cajal wisely exploited) helped to demonstrate that the nervous system arises from many discrete individual cells.<br>

<p>The structural and functional organization of the nervous system has been an area of great advancement during the twentieth century.  Much work on the mode of action of the reflex response (as well as on how reflexes are learned) and on the relation between inhibition and excitation of nerve tracks was done by Russian neurologists in the latter part of the nineteenth and especially the early part of the twentieth century. The chief figures there were Ivan Michailovich Sechenov (1829-1905) and Ivan P. Pavlov (1849-1936). Pavlov's inerest in digestion led him, under Sechenov's innuence, to study the now-classic conditioned reflex involved in salivation. Pavlov's life and work is the subject of one English-language volume: B.P. Babkin's <i>Pavlov, A Biography</i> (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1949). This source provides valuable insight into a whole school of neurological work that has had as much influence on psychology as on neurobiology in this century.<br>

<p>While the general features and functions of the reflex were understood by the turn of the century, its manner of organization (especially in terms of connections with the brain) was not. A towering figure in elucidating the relationship between central and peripheral nervous systems, and especially the integrative function of the spinal cord, was the British physiologist Charles Scott Sherrington (1857-1952).  Regnar Granit's biography, <i>Charles Scott Sherrington, An Appraisal</i> (London: Nelson, 1967), is outstanding, though it  suffers somewhat from historical presentism since the author is himself a distinguished neurobiologist. That deficiency is not a problem in Judith Swayze's <i>Reflexes and Motor Integration: Sharington's Concept of Integrative Action</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1969).  Swayze concentrates on a detailed but clear and insightful analysis of Sherrington's scientific background, his experimental methods, and the development of his hypotheses about integrative action.<br>

<p>The history of neurophysiology is less extensively explored than that of neurology, partly because major progress has been made only in the past several decades.  What few historical sources exist treat specific problems and are thus episodic. Concerning the development of the neurotransmitter hypothesis (that conduction across the synapse between adjacent  neurons occurs by a chemical rather than electrical process), its antagonists and protagonists, see Michael V. L. Bennett's "Nicked by Occam's Razor: Unitarianism in the Investigation of Synaptic Transmission," <i>Biological Bulletin</i>, Suppl., June 1985, 168:159-167. This article is the only source I know of that deals with this intriguing controversy in mid-twentieth- century neurophysiology.<br>

<p><font size=5>ECOLOGY & ANIMAL BEHAVIOR</font>    <p>The science of ecology--the study of the interrelationships among the biological and physical components in the natural world--has emerged as a distinct discipline only in the twentieth century. While naturalists from ancient times to the late nineteenth century noted the interdependence among organisms and the adaptations of organisms to their environment, the attempt to study those interactions as part of a larger natural system has occurred-only recently.<br>

<p>An excellent general introduction to the problems and recent sources in the history of ecology is Frank Egerton's two-part bibliographical essay "Thr History of Ecology: Achievements and Opportunities," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1983, 16:259-310, and 1985, 18:103-143. Another interesting general work is Donald Worster's <i>Nature's Economy, the Roots of Ecology</i> (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1979).  Worster's book is essential background reading and will provoke thought about, if not agreement with, the dialectic he sees between the views of earlier, romantic naturalists and those of hard-nosed quantitative ecologists in the period since the early 1900s.<br>

<p>As a field, ecology seems to have followed much the same historical development as other fields of biology, passing from a descriptive phase in the nineteenth century to a quantitative, experimental, and analytical phase in the twentieth.  The contradiction within ecology during this period was that between holistic and reductionistic, analytical and integrative, thinking.  An interesting survey that comes to much the same conclusion is Eugene P. Odum's "The Emergence of Ecology as a New Integrative Discipline," <i>Science</i>, 1977, 195:1289-1292.<br>

<p>As some scholars have pointed out, the development of ecology has been closely tied to evolving concepts of nature. Two very interesting papers, both dealing with the changing concept of nature, highlight this general view. One is Roderick Nash's "The Exporting and Importing of Nature: Nature-Appreciation as a Commodity, 1850-1980," <i>Perspectives in American History</i>, 1979, 12:519-560, in which the author argues that by the beginning of the twentieth century North America had little frontier or wilderness left. This, Nash claims, led to changing patterns of travel to "experience wild nature" in other areas such as Africa. Nash sees "nature appreciation" as a commodity for tourism, explaining the rapid growth of conservation movements in this country between 1890 and the present as an attempt to save the wilderness for the tourist industry.  On a somewhat different theme, Donald  Fleming, in "Roots of the New Conservation Movement," <i>Perspectives in American History</i>, 1972, 67:7-91, compares the old conservation movement of the Progressive  Era (the period discussed by Nash) to the "new" environmental and ecological movement emerging in the late 1960s.  Fleming argues that the new environmentalists represented a resurgence of a basic American transcendentalism and an opposition to the Judeo-Christian tradition of conquering nature.  Both articles treat the general concern for environment, and by association its "scientific" side (ecology), in terms of American social and intellectual history.  More directly concerned with the history of the scientific side is Sharon Kingsland's <i>Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology</i> (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1985), which deals with a series of important topics in twentieth-century ecology and evolution: mimicry, cryptic coloration, the concept of the niche and the community, island biogeography, and population structure.<br>

<p>Ethology as a field has received scant attention from historians, though several scholars have works in progress that should change this situation in the not-too-distant future.  There is one general historical introduction, W. H. Thorpe's <i>The Origins and Rise of Ethnology</i> (New York: Praeger 1979), but it is a summary by an eminent elder statesman in the field, not a critical history.  Of special value is John R. Durant's "Innate Character in Animals and Man: A Perspective on the Origins of Ethology," in <i>Biology, Medicine and Society, 1840-1940</i>, edited by Charles Webster (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1981), pp. 157-192.  A similarly brief but useful overview is Richard W. Burkhardt's "The Development of an Evolutionary Ethology," in <i>Evolution from Molecules to Man</i>, edited by D. W. Bendall (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1983), pp. 429-444.<br>

<p>Of the many biologists who have worked to establish the field of ethology in the twentieth century, only two have received biographical or historical treatment: William Morton Wheeler (1865-1937) and  Konrad Lorenz (1903-).  Wheeler's pioneering work with ant social organization  and behavior was instrumental in establishing ethology as a significant and serious branch of modern biology.  His biography by Mary Alice Evans and Howard Ensign Evans, <i>William Morton Wheeler, Biologist</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1970), is a rich source of information about, the history not only of ethology but of many other aspects of twentieth-century biology. The more recent <i>Konrad Lorenz</i>, by Alec Nisbet (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1976), portrays not only Lorenz himself but many of his contemporaries and explores the controversies that molded ethology between 1935 and 1965.  Nisbet is perhaps too enamored of his central character and does much to apologize for Lorenz's overt Nazi connections, but the biography covers a period of ethology not treated in detail by other writers. More scholarly and philosophical analyses of Lorenz's work have come from several historians of science: see, for example, Theodora J. Kalikow's "Konrad Lorenz's Ethological Theory: Explanation and Ideology," <i>Journal of the History of Biology</i>, 1983, 16:39-73. Kalikow's work is thorough, fair, and insightful, facing squarely the ideological basis of Lorenz's work that may have brought him into step with Nazi racial theory. In addition, there is Robert J. Richards's superb study of Lorenz's instinct theory: "The Innate and the Learned: The Evolution of Konrad Lorenz's Theory of Instinct," <i>Philosophy of the Social Sciences</i>, 1974, 4:111-133.<br>

<p>In teaching the history of twentieth-century biology (or any science,for that matter) there is a tendency to stick to the better-established areas and to treat science in a kind of social vacuum. I have often found it valuable to introduce one or more topics loosely called "biology and society" into courses in the history of biology. By "biology and society" I mean not so much the social history of science (which is important, too) as the direct use of an area of biology to attain or support a specific social or political end (e.g., the use of microbiology for germ warfare, of embryology for legislation on abortion, or of genetics for deciding immigration or reproductive policy). Such topics intrigue students and can introduce them to ways of thinking more carefully about similar issues today (e.g., sociobiology or the claim that criminality is genetic).  I include just a few topics in this category, with references to the most basic and accessible literature on each.<br>

<p><i><b>Eugenics</i></b>  Eugenics was a movement prominent in  England, the United States, Germany, several Scandinavian countries, and, to a lesser  extent, France and Russia from the early 1900s until the mid to late 1930s. It represented an attempt to use the then-new science of Mendelian genetics to explain and ultimately resolve many current social problems: chronic unemployment and poverty (pauperism), feeblemindedness, alcoholism, prostitution, rebelliousness, and  criminality.<br>

<p>Several general histories of eugenics have been written over the past two decades.  The oldest, but in some ways the  most comprehensive historically, is Mark Haller's <i>Hereditarian Attitudes in American Thought</i> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers Univ. Press, 1963). This book  traces the intellectual history of eugenics from its nineteenth-century background. More limited in scope but excellent within its own bounds is Kenneth Ludmerer's <i>Genetics and American Society</i> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1972). Ludmerer examines specifically the efforts of eugenicists to influence legislation on immigration restriction in the United States in the 1920s. For a more radical and overtly political analysis of the same period, see Garland E. Allen's "Genetics, Eugenics and Class Struggle," <i>Genetics</i>, 1975, 79:29-45; and "The Founding of the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor, 1910-1940: An Essay in Institutional History," <i>Osiris</i>, 1986, N.S. 2:225-264. Daniel J. Kevles's <i>In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity</i> (New York: Knopf, 1985) compares British and American eugenics on such issues as the importance of race and class, immigration and sterilization legislation, and education (propaganda). The latter chapters deal with the post-World War II development of eugenics as it was ultimately supplanted by what Kevles sees as the more scientifically valid study of human heredity.  For British eugenics, Geoffrey R. Searle's <i>Eugenics and Politics in Britain 1900-1914</i> (Leyden: Noordhoff 1976) examines in detail the British eugenicists' emphasis on national degeneration and class structure.  On the more contemporary issue of sterilization and genetic counseling, Philip Reilly has presented a remarkable historical and social analysis: <i>Genetics, Law and Social Policy</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1977). Reilly's book can be used as a follow-up to Ludmerer's <i>Genetics and American Society</i>.<br>

<p> <i><b>Population and Birth Control</i></b> There has been much discussion and controversy in recent years about the world's  so-called overpopulation problem. Many population control groups--privately and governmentally funded--have arisen in Western countries that seek, through a variety of means, to limit population growth, especially in the non-Western, Third World countries.  Like eugenics before it, the ideology of population control holds that a whole host of social problems have a biological cause: in this case, too high a reproductive rate.  Advocates of population control are known as Malthusians, or neo-Malthusians, after Thomas Robert Malthus,whose <i>Essay on Population</i> of 1798 first posed the thesis that poverty and hunger were caused by overpopulation.<br>

<p>Population control is inevitably related to birth control (the planning of family size by individual couples), and the two have interacted continuously throughout the present century. One of the best historical treatments of both movements is Allan Chase's <i>The Legacy of Malthus</i> (New York: Knopf, 1977). Although somewhat disorganized, Chase's book covers the birth control and eugenics movements in the early decades of the century and their eventual evolution into the population control movement after World War II. Two books dealing more with the birth control movement alone are Linda Gordon's <i>Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social History of Birth Control in America</i> (New York: Basic Books, 1978) and James Reed's <i>From Private Vice to Public Virtue: The Birth Control Movement and American Society since 1830</i> (New York: Basic, 1978).<br>

<p>Several stimulating and provocative works exist on the population control movement.  Paul R. Ehrlich's <i>The Population Bomb</i> (San Francisco: Freeman, 1968) is useful because it states the neo-Malthusian position clearly and forcefully and has had an enormous innuence on population thinking in the past seventeen years.  The opposite point of view is presented in several highly effective sources.  One of the most concise and readable, though less comprehensive, is Barry Commoner's "How Poverty Breeds Overpopulation (and  Not the Other Way Around)," <i>Ramparts</i>, 1975, 13:21-25. More complete and detailed, though less easy to read, is Bonnie Mass's <i>Political Economy of Population Control in Latin America</i> (Montreal: Editions Latin America, 1972).  This work contains a wealth of information about the socioeconomic effects of U.S. corporations, banking interests, and large-scale loans on the development of poverty and hunger in Third World countries.<br>

<p><i><b>Recombinant DNA and Genetic Engineering</b></i>  In recent decades the dangers as well as the benefits of advances in recombinant DNA technology have been the subject of much debate, both inside and outside of the biological community.  Volumes have been written on the subject from all sorts of perspectives-social and political, economic, ethical and moral, and technological.  The topic of genetic engineering-specifically that branch of it associated with DNA manipulation--is one virtually all students are acquainted with. A collection of original papers from the mid 1970s can be found in <i>The Recombinant DNA Debate</i>, edited by David A. Jackson and Stephen P. Stich (Englewood Cliffs, NJ.: Prentice-Hall, 1979). These papers cover such issues as safety, decision making, and the role of universities in relation to business, secrecy of research, patent ownership, and the like.  A systematic historical treatment of the whole recombinant DNA debate is offered in Sheldon Krimsky's <i>Genetic Alchemy: The Social History of the Recombinant DNA Controversy</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1982). This book presents a thorough, well-written, and balanced picture of the original controversy as it arose out of genetically remaking the adeno-S-40 virus in the mid 1970s.  This is the most scholarly and authoritative study of this episode currently available. On the specific issues recombinant DNA research has raised for universities with respect to patents, secrecy, and publication rights, see Charles Weiner's "Universities, Professors, and Patents: A Continuing Controversy," <i>Technology Review</i>, 1986, 83:33-43.  This article traces the history of university relations to patents from the early 1920s  through the recombinant DNA controversy of the 1970s.<br>

<p><i><b>Scientific Creationism</i></b>  The topic of scientific creationism--cumbersome, sometimes frustrating, but always intriguing--often comes up for discussion in both biology and history or sociology of science classes.  Several collections present the various arguments for and against creationism, especially its recent claims to be a "science."  The most complete is the volume edited by J. Peter Zetterberg, <i>Evolution versus Creationism: The Public Education Controversy</i> (Phoenix: Oryx Press,  1983). This volume contains articles on evolution and science education, statements of the creationist position today, biologists' responses to various creationist arguments, reprints of various state creationist laws, and the well-publicized Arkansas decision against creationism in the schools (1982).  
Another collection of essays, all against the creationist position, is <i>Science and Creationism</i>, edited by Ashley Montague (New York: Oxford Univ. Press,  1984), now available in paperback.  Lengthy defenses of modern Darwinism against the creationists' attacks are Douglas J. Futuyma's <i>Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution</i> (New York: Pantheon Books, 1983) and Michael Ruse's <i>Darwinism Defended: A Guide to the Evolution Controversies</i> (Reading, Pa.: Addison-Wesley, 1982). Ruse's book has more historical and philosophical detail, but in many ways Futuyma's is a clearer and more up-to-date presentation of the evolutionary position.  An examination of the controversy from a religious  perspective is <i>Evolution and Creation</i>, edited by Ernan McMullin (South Bend, Ind.: Univ. Notre Dame Press, 1985).  The brunt of McMullin's own essay, as well as of others in the volume, is that there is no necessary contradiction between a creationist and an evolutionary point of view.  To my mind the best account of the historical and sociological roots of the current controversy is Dorothy Nelkin's <i>The Creation Controversy: Science or Scripture in the Schools</i> (New York: Norton, 1982), subtitled "A History of the Struggle between Creationists and Scientists from the Nineteenth Century to the Arkansas Trial." On a more limited but equally interesting level is the autobiography of John T. Scopes, who went on trial in Dayton, Tennessee, in 1926 for teaching evolution in his high school biology class: John T. Scopes and James Presley, <i>Center of the Storm The Memoirs of John T. Scopes</i> (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1967). <br>

      was evident in the
    nineteenth century in the context of infectious disease (<a href="theorimm.htm#The role of Ehrlich">Click here</a>). These barriers are both external
    (e.g. hygiene), and internal (e.g. the immune response). Internally, our bodies (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">self</font>&quot;) can detect and destroy members of other species (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">not-self</font>&quot;; i.e. viruses, bacteria, protozoa).</font></p>
    <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another, no less
    subtle form of self/not-self discrimination, involves our detection of a mate (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">near-self</font>&quot;) who will be our &quot;<font color="#0000A0">physiological
    complement</font>&quot; such that the union will produce healthy offspring (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">hybrids</font>&quot;). An incestuous relationship with a close relative
    (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">too near-self</font>&quot;) will probably result in less
    healthy offspring. On the other hand, extreme out-breeding, such as with an ape
    (<font color="#0000A0">not-self</font>), is prohibited by species barriers.</font></p>
    <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is more to this
    than just the inability to copulate (the gamete transfer barrier). There are both
    <em><b><font color="#0080C0">external</font></b></em> components (e.g. mate choice), and
    <em><b><font color="#0080C0">internal</font></b></em> components. Even if the male sperm could meet and
    fuse with the female ovum, the resulting cell (&quot;zygote&quot;)
    might be unable to grow from embryo to an adult organism (developmental barrier resulting in &quot;<font color="#0000A0">hybrid inviability</font>&quot;). Even if these transfer and developmental
    barriers were overcome, in the gonad (testes, ovary) the two sets of parental chromosomes
    might be unable to pair for gamete-production (gonadal barrier resulting in &quot;<font color="#0000A0">hybrid sterility</font>&quot;). Our modern understanding of these barriers
    began with Charles Darwin's <strong><font color="#804040"><i>The Origin of Species </i></font></strong>(1859).</font></p>

      entitled &quot;Physiological Selection: An Additional Suggestion on the Origin of

      the horse and the ass as members of separate natural species, when a cross is made between

      primarily on the sterility barrier, often the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>only</i></strong></font>
      barrier separating members of closely related
      species (i. e. species likely to have arisen recently from a common originating species).
      He suggested that, like cells of all other organs and tissues, germ line cells might
      undergo random variations. Variations, for example, in height or eye colour were familiar
      to everyone. No one knew what caused variations, but no one doubted their existence.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="6">R</font><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">omanes
      emphasized one possible class of variation affecting germ line cells, which would make an
      organism less fertile with other members of the species but not influence somatic
      characters. Normally the loss of fertility would be highly disadvantageous because the
      organism would leave no offspring. However, he further argued that if two organisms
      underwent the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>same</i></strong></font> type of variation,
      they would still be fertile <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>between themselves</i></strong></font>.
      They would be &quot;<font color="#0000A0">physiological complements</font>&quot;. Hence,
      at any time-point a species would consist of the parental group (comprising the majority
      of species members), and numerous small variant groups. Members of each variant group
      would be less fertile with members of the parental group and of the other variant groups.
      Members of each group, to varying degrees, would be &quot;<font color="#0000A0">reproductively
      isolated</font>&quot; from members of the other groups, but remain quite fertile with each
      other. Hybrid sterility would be an extreme manifestation of the phenomenon.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romanes demonstrated
      that irrespective of any selective
      factors in the environment (no &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;
      required), members of the reproductively variant groups would tend also to be somatically
      variant, just as members of the parental group would tend to be somatically variant (e.g.
      changes in height or muscular strength). In the absence of environmental selection,
      however, somatic variations of members of the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>large</i></strong></font>
      parental group would not be sustained, because these members were crossing freely with
      each other, a process which tended to blend and neutralize variations. For example,
      although humans vary in height, tall people cross with small people and the average height
      tends to remain constant.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand,
      variations within a <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>small</i></strong></font> variant
      group would not be subjected to this &quot;swamping&quot;
      effect due to blending with members of the parental group (i.e. there would be less
      non-variants to dilute the variation). Because of this reproductive isolation, the
      variation would be sustained. If, by chance, the variation happened to confer some
      advantage to members of the variant group, relative to members of the parental group, that
      would be a bonus. The selective advantage conferred would allow the commencement
      of classical Darwinian natural selection.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major difference
      between the old Darwinian formulation (natural selection), and the new Romanesian
      formulation (physiological selection) was that in the first case, natural selection
      preceded reproductive isolation, where in the second case reproductive isolation preceded
      natural selection (Figure 2). Reproductive isolation, in any shape or form, would suffice,
      but the most usual form of isolation would result from physiological selection. Of course
      in a large population it would be very unlikely that a male and a female whose gonads had
      undergone the same rare variation would encounter each other. Thus the variation would
      probably not be perpetuated. Indeed, as Romanes pointed out, successful speciation was
      rare.</font></td>

      opposition to Mendel, and seemed to have forgotten Romanes's work. However, late in
      Bateson's career the overwhelming importance of the phenomenon of hybrid sterility dawned
      on him, and he began to consider its possible causes. In 1913 Bateson dismissed sterility
      associated with certain anther variants in plants as being due to a &quot;simple recessive character,&quot; implying that sterility due to
      defects in one or a few defined characters was unlikely to be of general significance for the evolution of species.<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;
      Microscopical studies of the gonads of sterile hybrids supported this view.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the set of
      chromosomes carrying genes contributed by the mother pair, on a one-to-one basis, with the
      complementary set of chromosomes carrying the genes contributed by the father. Close
      identity is essential for this pairing, which is required so that subsequent cell division
      and multiplication can proceed, resulting in the formation of gametes (sperms and ova). In
      hybrid sterility the pairing is defective and a degenerate gonad results. Thus the
      question of the origin of species becomes a question of the origin of hybrid sterility,
      which, in turn, leads to the question of the nature of the chromosomal <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>incompatibilities</i></font></strong> which prevent pairing, or
      conversely, the nature of the chromosomal <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>compatibilities</i></font></strong>
      which permit pairing. Reminiscent of Romanes's position, Bateson interpreted hybrid

      was strictly the result of a failure of the pairing of complementary chromosomes was

      could pair (i.e. chromosomes from the mother could pair with each other, and chromosomes
      from the father could pair with each other). If the sterility had been due to a defect in

      the work of William Hamilton and George Williams, added a fresh perspective to Darwinian
      ideas.<sup>39-41</sup> However, the new viewpoint was largely biological, and many
      inconsistencies remained. Then in the 1990s came the genome project and a deluge of DNA
      sequence data from biochemical laboratories. The first results of the bioinformatic
      analysis of these data have suddenly given the story fresh impetus. It appears that the
      chromosomal incompatibility which allows species to originate either arises from &quot;<font color="#0000A0">macromutations</font>&quot; which affect chromosome segments<sup>31, 33</sup>,
      or is the <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>cumulative</i></font></strong> result of
      numerous &quot;<font color="#0000A0">micromutations</font>,&quot; as proposed by the

      specify the nature of the &quot;<font color="#000000">peculiarity of the reproductive
      system</font>&quot; which would lead to reproductive isolation.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strength of the
      micromutation proposal is that it allows fine degrees of compatibility, so that a rare
      reproductive variant would be more likely to find a partially matching physiological
      complement. The proposal arose from the perception that DNA, the molecule in chromosomes
      which transmits hereditary information, has <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>two levels</i></font></strong>
      of information. There is nothing strange about this. A radio operator has to decide what
      message to transmit, and on what wavelength to transmit it. Thus the radio signal contains
      primary information (the message) and secondary information (the wavelength). The message
      is basically the same whatever wavelength is employed. The role of the secondary
      information is to allow discrimination between messages; it allows the receiver to tune

      possessed an immature, white, sheep. In class-conscious England at the beginning of the

      dropped <strong>H</strong>s as micromutations. The secondary information, because of such
      micromutations, constitutes a &quot;<font color="#0000A0">reproductive barrier</font>&quot;.
      Cockneys tend to marry cockneys and perpetuate cockney secondary information. The middle
      class tend to marry into the middle class and perpetuate middle class secondary
      information. Thus, Eliza appeared to be reproductively isolated from Freddy largely
      because of her language. Although, perhaps with some difficulty, both could understand
      each other's primary information, the secondary information (Eliza's dropped <strong>H</strong>s)
      seemed to constitute a barrier. </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaw tells us that
      Professor Higgins performed the appropriate experiment. He demonstrated that if the
      linguistic barrier were removed, then the reproductive barrier would also be removed.
      Eliza and Freddy lived happily-ever-after. We can say that they then possessed &quot;<font color="#000000">linguistic complements</font>&quot;, by which we mean that they approached
      linguistic identity. Alternatively, we can say that until Professor Higgins had performed
      his magic, their reciprocal differences, or &quot;<font color="#000000">complementary
      factors</font>&quot; (Eliza's dropped <strong>H</strong>s, and Freddy's included <strong>H</strong>s)
      kept them reproductively isolated. </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to
      note that Eliza's cockney accent was a global characteristic of her speech. Each sentence
      she spoke was influenced by it. While each sentence provided a <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>discrete</i></strong></font>
      piece of &quot;<font color="#0000A0">primary</font>&quot; information, which was localized
      <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>in that sentence</i></strong></font>, the &quot;<font color="#0000A0">secondary&quot;</font> information (her accent) was diffused across all
      sentences. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also note
      that once the marriage knot had been tied (i.e. the barrier to reproduction formally
      removed), a good chance existed that, even if her accent subsequently regressed (diverged
      from Freddy's, so that linguistic complementarity was lost), the marriage (reproduction)
      would continue. Thus the <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>initial</i></font></strong>
      secondary information (a reproductive barrier) needed only to be removed <strong><font color="#0000A0"><i>temporarily</i></font></strong> until a more substantial (legal) way of
      removing the barrier had been substituted.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arrus BT" size="5">This latter point
      proves of considerable importance when we move back to the problem of gaining evidence for
      two levels of information in DNA. Whatever the <font color="#000000">initial</font>
      isolation process which led to the divergence between ancestral lines leading to, say, the
      modern elephant and mouse, it is clear that there is now a more substantial barrier to
      reproduction between the two (a gamete transfer barrier). It would probably be fruitless
      to examine these species for molecular clues as to the way the initial divergence took
      place (Figure 3). In virus species, however, signs of the initial isolation process might
      still exist. This, indeed, seems to be the case with viruses with the potential to coexist
      in the same host cell<sup><span class="auto-style5">42</span></sup>.</font></td>

      A divergence in this secondary information, through accumulation of
        micromutations,
      appears likely to initiate the speciation process<sup>42,47</sup>. We should note that

              forms part of a small block in William Street, Kingston. Shortly after the move we found

          1890, Walter Heape (1855-1928) successfully transferred rabbit embryos
          from one mother to another, thus performing what we believe was the
          first mammalian embryo transfer. He thus achieved what Romanes had
          attempted but failed to do; namely, to demonstrate that, at least
          during the period of embryogenesis, the postulated &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmules</font>&quot;
          or &quot;<font color="#0000A0">pangens</font>&quot; of genetic
          information postulated by Darwin, could <u> not</u> be transferred from the
          mother to the foetus. The new born rabbits had all the characters of
          the biological parent. However, while Heape asked &quot;<font color="#0000A0">What
          effect, if any, does a uterine foster-mother have upon her
          foster-children?</font>&quot;, he made no claim to be testing Darwin's
          hypothesis of pangenesis.</font></p>
          <p <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biggers (1991) suggests
          that &quot;<font color="#0000A0">Romanes abandoned his ovarian
          transplantation and embryo transfer studies when he became convinced,
          somewhat surprisingly, that, when two breeds of rabbit hybridize, no
          intermediate between the two parental forms are produced.</font>&quot;
          In theory, at least some of Darwin's &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmules</font>&quot;
          should have transferred between the two parental genomes to produce
          intermediate types. Thus, in his own way, Romanes had rediscovered
          some of what Naudin and Mendel had discovered in the 1860s.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romanes did not easily give
          up on the possibility of &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmule</font>&quot;
          transfer, which might explain the acquisition of acquired properties (Lamarkism).
          Shortly before his premature death in 1894 he wrote to Sharpey-Schafer
          (May 18th) who had reported some success in transfer experiments:</font></p>

                  several years experimenting with rats, rabbits and [&nbsp; ],
                  that one may breed scores and hundreds of first crosses
                  between different varieties, and never get a single mongrel
                  throwing off intermediate characters - or indeed any
                  resemblance to one side of the house. Yet, if the younger are
                  subsequently crossed inter se (i.e. brothers and sisters, of
                  first crossings) the crossed parentage at once repeats itself.
                  Ergo, even if the pups wh. are born appear to give a negative
                  result, keep them to breed from with one another.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p></td>

          cited Mendel in a review for the <b><i><font color="#804040">Encyclopedia
          Britannica</font></i></b>), this is what Mendel reported with pea
          crosses in 1865.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much like Romanes, Walter Heape was independently
          wealthy and was educated by a private tutor. He was interested in the
          application of scientific knowledge to human welfare, but appreciated
          how inadequate was the knowledge base. He supervised the construction
          of the Plymouth Laboratory under the auspices of the Marine Biological
          Association to serve the fishing industry. At Cambridge, he was a
          student of Foster, and here he probably first encountered William
          Bateson. At a critical point, he was appointed to the Evolution
          Committee of the Royal Society of London. Here, the knives were out
          between Bateson and the &quot;<font color="#0000A0">Biometricians</font>&quot; (including Weldon).
          The Committee ended in backing Bateson. Heape's work was confirmed by
          Castle &amp; Phillips (1909) with guinea pigs.</font></p>
          <p <p align="justify"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          A related issue was whether prior fertilization by one male could be
          evident in the offspring of fertilization by another male (&quot;<font color="#0000A0">telogony</font>&quot;).
          Thus, a woman might have, by a second husband, children who resembled
          a former husband. The &quot;<font color="#0000A0">gemmules</font>&quot;
          of the ex-husband would have persisted long enough to influence
          later children (a handy excuse for a randy ex). This was investigated by another member of the
          Evolution Committee, J. Cossar Ewart (1851-1933),
          who had collaborated in research with Romanes in Scotland in the
          1870s, and had been supported by Romanes in seeking (and obtaining)
          the Chair of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh. He
          prompted Lord Rosebery to sponsor a series of lectures by Romanes in
          1888 on &quot;<font color="#0000A0">The Philosophy of Natural History</font>,&quot;

      results from the accumulation of many evolutionary &quot;events&quot;, each involving some
      or all of four processes: <u>variation</u>, <u>heredity</u> (inheritance), <u>phenotypic
      selection</u>, <u>reproductive isolation</u>. An evolutionary event begins with variation
      and is followed by the process of heredity continuing through the generations.
    Differential selection
      may follow variation. </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#004080"><u><strong><i>Variation</i></strong></u></font><font color="#804040"> 
	  (like does not produce like). There is variation among members of a biological species
      and the resulting variant members are candidates for
      differential selection. Variation
      is a </font><font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>process</i></strong></font><font color="#804040"> which produces the variant features of variant organisms. These variant
      features are themselves often referred to as variations. Thus the word &quot;</font><font color="#0000A0">variation</font></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">&quot;
      must be understood in context either as the <i>process</i>, or as the <i> result</i> of that process.
      Some variant features are latent or cryptic (i.e. not immediately observable). </font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font color="#004080" face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><strong>Heredity</strong></i></u></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4"> (like produces like). There is inheritance of a
      newly acquired variation by at least some of the offspring of variant members, and
      inheritance of that variation, in turn, by some of their offspring, and some of the
      subsequent offspring. If a variation is not inherited (overtly or cryptically) then it may
      be the result of some environmental influence and is not strictly related to the
      evolutionary event under consideration. Thus, increased muscular strength 
	  acquired through exercise would not be transferred to offspring. </font></p>
	  <p <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" SIZE="5">
	  &nbsp;<font color="#004080" face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><strong>Blending 
	  inheritance</strong></i></u></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4"> 
	  (like and non-like merge). Recombination being a rare and random 
	  event, each gene tends to be inherited intact and a corresponding 
	  character may emerge unblended with other characters. Thus, the major factor 
	  determining tallness in peas is stem-length, which is controlled by one 
	  gene. The tall character is inherited without blending. The individual pea 
	  plant is either tall or short. There are no intermediates. However, often 
	  dominance is incomplete, so a blended phenotype appears among offspring. 
	  Thus, all the offspring of a cross between red and white flowering plants 
	  may all be pink in the first generation. Furthermore, numerous characters are multigenic 
	  (non-allelic). Thus, tallness in man 
	  depends on the lengths of many individual bones. It was recognized by 
	  Mendel, Bateson and, later, Fisher, that multigenic characters will blend 
	  in offspring (i.e. a range of intermediates will be observed). Thus, the 
	  extent of phenotypic variation offered to natural selection 
	  will be decreased relative to non-blending inheritance. Blending inheritance will tend to slow the rate of 
	  evolutionary change.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font></p>

      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#004080"><u><i><strong>Selection</strong></i></u></font>.
      The words &quot;<font color="#0000A0">selection</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color="#0000A0">isolation</font>&quot; have led to confusion. The words have the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>same</i></strong></font> meaning, although one may be preferred
      in a particular context. Selection is something which can be done when there is more than
      one of something. If there is only one of something, then it can be
      considered as <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>already</i></strong></font>
      selected (or isolated). In much of the literature, &quot;<font color="#0000A0">selection</font>&quot;
      often means phenotypic selection; &quot;<font color="#0000A0">isolation</font>&quot;
      often means reproductive selection.</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#004080"><u><i><strong>Phenotypic
      selection </strong></i></u></font>There is positive selection of
      members of the species with advantageous variations, and negative selection of members of
      the species with disadvantageous variations. This isolation on the basis of phenotypic
      adaptations (positive or negative) is the type of selection with which Darwin was
      primarily concerned. In this respect he and others spoke of &quot;survival of the
      fittest&quot; and the &quot;</font></font><font face="Arrus BT" size="4" color="#950000">struggle for existence</font><font color="#804040"><font size="4">&quot;. He used the term &quot;<font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>natural</i></strong>
      selection</font>&quot; to distinguish this form of phenotypic
      selection from the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>artificial</i></strong></font> selection carried out by the
      horticulturalist or breeder. However, reproductive
      isolation/selection can <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>also</i></strong></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4"> be natural or artificial. </font></font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><i><u><font color="#004080"><strong>Reproductive
      isolation</strong></font></u></i>. Variation, heredity and
      phenotypic selection can operate so that advantageous phenotypic characteristics
      tend to increase in a population, and disadvantageous phenotypic characteristics
      tend to decrease in a population. They provide for the <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>adaptation</i></strong></font> of species, and operate primarily at the level of the individual member
      of the species (individual selection). Ultimately, this linear process
      (isolation of the fit from the unfit) can
      lead to new species (i.e. one that would have been reproductively 
	  incompatible with the ancestral species if the cross were still possible). Here the fit are
	  <font face="Arrus BT" size="4" color="#804040"> <i><font color="#0000A0"><strong>reproductively isolated </strong></font></i></font>
	  from the unfit, because the latter are eliminated. However, sometimes an 
	  origin of species arises from a divergence&nbsp; 
	  between two equally fit populations, and <i><font color="#0000A0"><strong>reproductive isolation</strong></font></i>
      is needed more directly. To originate species in this way (isolation of the fit from the
      fit) <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>groups</i></strong></font> have to be selected. Speciation
      (species selection) is a form of <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>group
      selection</i></strong></font></font></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">.
      A group is a set of units. For our purposes, if there is only one unit in a set it is an
      individual, and does not constitute a group. A group whose members reproduce only
      asexually is, by definition, already reproductively isolated from other groups. </font><font color="#804040"></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><font color="#004080"><strong>Species
      </strong></font></i></u>. The most secure definition of a biological
      species is a group of organisms which is <font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>reproductively
      isolated</i></strong></font></font></font><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">
      from other groups of organisms. Members of the group are unable to cross
      (continue the line) with all
      other organisms except those organisms which belong to the group.
      Inability to cross includes the production of offspring that are sterile
      (infertile). Degrees of infertility
      are characteristic of organisms at the species interface (i.e. potential incipient
      species).</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><u><i><font color="#004080"><strong>Hybrid</strong></font></i></u><font color="#804040">. The offspring of crosses between members of two anatomically distinct
      lines (varieties, races) are often referred to as &quot;hybrids&quot;. Since the
      definition of species is based primarily on reproductive performance, rather than
      anatomical difference, this can lead to confusion. For our purposes </font><font color="#0000A0"><strong><i>any</i></strong></font><font color="#804040"> offspring is the
      hybrid of its parents if the parents are different genomically. There may
      be hybrid vigour
      (&quot;positive heterosis&quot;). There may be &quot;negative
      heterosis&quot; manifest as </font><font color="#004080"><em><strong>hybrid
      inviability</strong></em></font><font color="#804040"> (developmental barrier) or </font><font color="#004080"><em><strong>hybrid sterility</strong></em></font><font color="#804040">
      (gonadal barrier). For humans, the only possible offspring not a &quot;hybrid&quot; would
      be the extremely improbable case of a female who inherited absolutely identical sequences
      from both parents. In the case of a human male, even if the autosomes were absolutely
      identical, the sex chromosomes would differ; so, under our definition, all males are
      hybrids.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font color="#804040" face="Arrus BT" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font><font face="Arrus BT" size="4"><font color="#804040">
      More usually, the term is used in the context of a specific character
      (e.g. height). An organism may be pure (homozygous) for that character
      (e.g. corresponding paternal and maternal chromosomes both contain a gene
      conferring tallness), or it may be a hybrid for that character (e.g. the paternal
      chromosome may contain a gene conferring tallness and the maternal
      chromosome may contain a gene conferring smallness). If tallness is
      dominant, then the hybrid (heterozygote) may be as tall as organisms which
      are homozygously tall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p <p align="justify"><font color="#004080"><strong><em><u>Genome</u></em></strong></font><font color="#804040">.
      This term might be interpreted by the uninitiated as &quot;gene
      home&quot;. We talk of &quot;the human genome&quot; or &quot;the genome of the bacterium <em>Escherichia
      coli</em>&quot;. We usually mean the most obvious form of genetic material, which in these
      organisms is DNA. It is true that most of the <em>E. coli</em> genome consists of genes,
      but in &quot;higher&quot; organisms there is much DNA which is not so obviously
      &quot;genic&quot;. Our genomes are not just &quot;gene homes&quot;. Note also that a piece
      of the genome which we recognize as a &quot;gene&quot; may be serving functions other than
      those conventionally considered &quot;genic&quot;. This is considered more in the
      Bioinformatics/Genomics section of these pages.</font><font color="#804040" face="Dutch 801 Roman" size="3"></p>

This gives us a view of the history of evolution as a kind of <a href="DIREVOL.html">progression</a> towards  <a href="COMPGROW.html">higher complexity</a> (albeit essentially unpredictable, with many side-tracks and dead-ends). Such an encompassing view may allow us to answer the<a href="ETERQUES.html"> basic questions</a>: "Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going to?" (The last question requires an extrapolation of this development towards the <a href="FUTEVOL.html">future</a>.) <p>Although the <a href="COMPGROW.html">growth of complexity</a> during evolution is not universal (many systems evolve towards higher simplicity), it appears as the most striking factor from a long-term perspective. Most of the time this complexity increase, and evolution in general, occurs rather slowly or continuously, but during certain periods evolution accelerates spectacularly. This results in changes which from a long term perspective may be viewed as momentous events, separating  discrete types of organization. Each time a higher level of <a href="CONTROL.html">control</a> or organization has developed we say that a <a href="MST.html">Metasystem Transition</a> (MST) has taken place. <p>The MST concept makes it possible to reconstruct the sequence of evolutionary events from the beginnning of time to the present as a partially ordered series of metasystem transitions. These transitions can be roughly classified in four categories or "tracks": <ol><li><a href="PREBEVOL.html">Prebiotic</a>: the developments taking place before the origin of the life, i.e. the emergence of physico-chemical complexity: the Big Bang, space and time, energy and particles, atoms and the different elements, molecules up to organic polymers, simple dissipative structures.<li><a href="BIOEVOL.html">Biological</a>: the origin of life and the further development of the specifically biological aspects of it: DNA, reproduction, autopoiesis, prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes, multicellularity, sexual reproduction, the species.<li><a href="COGNEVOL.html">Cognitive</a>:  the origin of mind, i.e. the basic cybernetic, cognitive organization, going from simple reflexes to complex nervous systems, learning, and thought.<li><a href="SOCEVOL.html"> Social</a>: the development of social systems and culture: communication, cooperation, moral systems, memes</ol>Although most of the transitions taken place sequentially within each main track, and these track emerge roughly in the order they are presented here, there is also essential interaction between the categories. For example, communication and cooperation between organisms (social track) takes place before rational thought (cognitive track) emerges, and is in a mutual positive <a href="FEEDBACK.html">feedback</a> relation with that cognitive transition. Similarly,<a href="SEX.html"> sexual reproduction</a> (biological) appears in parallel with the emergence of reflexes (cognitive) and influences the appearance of social cooperation via its formation of family groupings.<p>For a chronology of some of these transitions, see the <img src=Images/externallink.GIF><a TARGET=_blank href="http://rumba.ics.uci.edu/origins/cosmo_timeline.html">Cosmological</a> and <img src=Images/externallink.GIF><a TARGET=_blank href="http://rumba.ics.uci.edu/origins/geo_timeline.html">Evolutionary/Geological </a>Timelines.</nodetxt><p><p><p><HR WIDTH=420><font size=-1><a href="/COPYR.html">Copyright&copy; 1994 Principia Cybernetica</a> - <a href="REFERPCP.html">Referencing this page</a></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=140 BGCOLOR=DED6A5><TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=15 BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR=FFF5CB><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>      <BR>   <B> <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>Author</FONT></B><br>  <FONT SIZE=-1> <author>F. <a rev=made href="HEYL.html">Heylighen</a>, C. <a rev=made href="JOSLYN.html">Joslyn</a>, V. <a rev=made href="TURCHIN.html">Turchin</a>, </author></FONT><p>   <B> <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>Date</FONT></B>   <BR><FONT SIZE=-1><update>Nov 16, 1994</update> (modified)<br><create>Aug 1993</create> (created)</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>   <TABLE CELLPADDING=10 BORDER=0><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>      <CENTER>   <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF " SIZE=-1>    <a href=/DEFAULT.html>Home</a><br><img src=/Images/up.gif><br><FONT SIZE=-1><parent><a href=/MSTT.html>Metasystem Transition Theory</a></parent></FONT>      </FONT>      <P><B>    <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>     Up      <BR>      <A HREF="/TRIALMST.html">Prev.</A>      <img src="/Images/4arrows.gif" width="37" height="36" align="middle">      <a HREF="/PREBEVOL.html">Next</A>      <BR>   Down   </FONT>   </B>       </CENTER><HR><P>     <FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF" SIZE=-1>   <child><a href="PREBEVOL.html">Physical Evolution [empty]</a><p> <a href="BIOEVOL.html">Biological Evolution</a><p> <a href="COGNEVOL.html">Cognitive Evolution (stages)</a><p> <a href="SOCEVOL.html">Social Evolution</a><p> </child>   </FONT>      </TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=140 BGCOLOR=DED6A5>   <CENTER><P><HR align="left" noshade><a href="/MAKANNOT.html">Discussion</a><HR></CENTER>              <FONT SIZE=-1>   <P><annot><ul><li><a rel=subdocument href="/Annotations/HISTEVOL.0.html">CHANGE MY MIND</a>,  Comment by Trevor Mott<li><a rel=subdocument href="/Annotations/HISTEVOL.1.html">References request</a>,  Comment by Tristan Doelnitz<li><a rel=subdocument href="/Annotations/HISTEVOL.2.html">I have a question...</a>,  Comment by anonymous<li><a rel=subdocument href="/Annotations/HISTEVOL.3.html">Potentially turning the tables...</a>,  Comment by Darrell Gudmundson</ul></annot>   </FONT>   <CENTER>   <P><FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA, SANS-SERIF"><a TARGET=_blank href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/hypercard.acgi$annotform?">Add comment...</a></FONT><p>         <img src="/Images/space.gif" width="7" height="7" align="middle">   </CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>++++++++++++++++++++<Over>++++++++++++++++++++

Queen Elizabeth -  Charles Darwin</H3>
<H4><P align = justify>Queen Elizabeth I of England ascended to the throne in 1558. The last women of sole political power had been a Greek Egyptian Pharaoh named Cleopatra in the mid-1st century B.C. She reemerged in the 16th century as Elizabeth I.  Her century is marked by the break away of Protestant churches from the authority of the Pope, whose Catholic authority had been instituted by the sword of the French King, Charlemagne, in the 8th century. Elizabeth was raised during intense religious strife between the Catholics and Protestants. She began her reign with rejections of marriage alliances with Spain, France and English nobles to rule as the Virgin Queen.  As Queen she managed to pass a unification act that created a single Church of England that excluded papal authority. Elizabeth, however, seemed to be more enchanted with the arts encouraging the works of Shakespeare. 

<P align = justify>Elizabeth has to be one of the luckiest Queens who ever lived. While being a caring monarch, she had inherited a destitute country torn by religious civil war and her country desperately needed time to heal. The Spanish were not happy with England's exploration of the America's. The Spanish lead by Columbus had arrived first in America and eventually Spain had had enough when a revolt broke out against Spanish controlled ports in the Netherlands, aided by the English who had refused to align themselves with Spain. King Phillip II of Spain dispatched a fleet of ships, the Armada, in June of 1588 to blockade the northern harbors. The English fought back against the blockade; though the English had only a destitute navy, they did have home ground advantage, so there were give and takes on both sides. The deciding blow came, however, with a terrible storm in August that broke Spanish moral and sent only 67 ships out of 130 back home to Spain.

<P align = justify>How different life might be if the Spanish had won or even if a long seize had prevented the English from settling North America before the Spanish. Would we now be speaking Spanish in North American instead of English. I doubt the United States as we know it with its constitutional democracy would have been created by the Spanish for they had a strong faith in divine order. It was their belief in Catholicism that had driven the Moors out and reestablished Spain as a world power, creating a Spain who had become extremely wealthy through dominance on the seas. The Spanish had lost more than sunken ships that could have easily been rebuilt with their wealth, but it was a loss of faith in the power of providence to protect the defense of their faith. Least the Protestants claim in was an act of God on their behalf, Queen Elizabeth reign had been spared and her reign was one of the worldliness and individuality, a journey that had begun with the signing of the Magna Charta in 1215. The Puritans felt the forces that had protected Elizabeth were evil and after Elizabeth's death sought to rid England of artistic corruption. Moderate protestants eventually gained control and some of the Puritans fled to New England and eventually innocent women were hanged for being witches. In the states Thomas Jefferson sided with the libertarians and wrote the Declaration of Independence with a stated a belief in "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." But perhaps it would be wise not to assume it was a libertarian wind either. Life and order are also virtues which necessitates a written constitutional to maintain <I>civil</I> liberties. Perhaps it was just an unexpected hurricane, a random anomaly that happens in nature from time to time. 

<P align = justify>It certainly was the way Darwin saw the evolution of life in the 1860's when he published case studies to prove species mutated. It is important at this point,  however, to emphasize that Darwin's first chapter in his book <I>The Origin of Species</I> is on domestication. But in the absence of domestication, life becomes an accident. A roll of the dice from which fitness would determine the outcome. How picky have his critics been over his choice of the word fitness. Certainly goodness should have been stated rather than fitness. But what is fitness? It could be goodness. Jesus, however, died despite his innocence with the advancement of the Roman military might; even though Rome too eventually crumbled, but for them it was corruption from within. What of England, are they the most fair of all people because God had destroyed their enemies with a mighty storm? Or are we, as evolutionary theory states, a connected human race, connected through our ancestry with the chimpanzees. Even more troubling for many, is in the absence of human domestication does not God have a role in determining the destiny of man. But what is God. There are so many definitions of God or Goddess today that the very act of defining it can leave people arguing about a person's rights of worship which puts God in the realms of choice and individuality. 

<P align = justify>Darwin theories today are used in medicine to understand and care for the natural evolutionary development of the body from birth to death, and to stop unwanted mutations such as deadly bacteria, viruses, and cancer that prematurely destroys the body. When we are sick and visit a physician, we are generally not in the mood for a moral examination before the doctor will treat our illnesses. Many illnesses are a product of chance and those that are our fault, the lectures can wait until we are on the mend. Darwin is used in biology in the development and care of new crops, livestock and personal pets. It makes one wonder if the Kansas School Board of Education decision to make the teaching of evolutionary theory voluntary, believes in educating farmers. Perhaps they want to return to the Garden of Eden by allowing natural selection to have its way without care for domestication. 

<P align = justify>Darwin is also used in reconstruction of history. This is generally where the problems begin with creationists and their interpretations of the Bible. Genesis has a creation myth that has a seven day time limit on it. One interpretation is that each day is a thousand years. Another interpretation is the earth was created in a shorter time frame than would allow natural selection to have happened, therefore the earth must have been created by divine order. Radio-isotope dating shows that multi-cellular organisms to have existed for over 700 millions years which does allow natural selection to have been at work. It was actually Thomas Henry Huxley in 1863 in <I>Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature</I> who suggested that man evolved from Apes. Current genetic testing has shown that our closest relative is the chimpanzees. This is another supposed contradiction of the Bible because Genesis says Adam was created from the dust of the earth, which creationists interpret as Adam being created separate from the animals in a single act of creation. This scripture could just as easily say be interpreted as Adam evolved from dust to single cell to ape to man. Even among secular Americans there is a feeling that Darwin undermined the power of religion to motivate the soul. The facts are Darwin's book was written after the American constitution which had already separated state from church, while the Church of England, which is still supported by England today, buried Darwin in Westminster Abbey in 1882.  

<H3><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="100%">    
Pythagoras - Hypatia</H3>

<P align = justify>The formal scientific debate over evolution began in the 4th century BC. Alexander the Great was the Greek conquerer who extended the Greek empire through out the middle east. Conquering, however, might not be the right word. The Persian army literally allowed Alexander to defeat their king in single combat, then they willingly picked up their swords to follow him into Egypt. Egypt's New Kingdom dynasty had previously collapsed and easily feel into his hands. 

<P align = justify>So why did the Persians so willing follow a foreigner? Intellectuals are fond of pointing out that Aristotle, a scholar trained by Plato of Athens, was Alexander's tutor. After Alexander's rise to power, Aristotle became a great teacher in Athens with a school he called the Lyceum whose purpose was to classify nature. Aristotle was an innovative scientist, having begun the classification of species that has been improved upon to this day. A natural question with such classification is: Where did the different species come from? Aristotle said perfect patterns were set in the beginning by an unchanging heaven and as such cats would always be cats, dogs would always be dogs, and men would always be superior to women, as kings were to the common man. 

<P align = justify>Aristotle had a very different view of the heavens, not at all like the tradition stories handed down by Athens. The pantheon of gods ruled by Zeus and Hera were seen as the planets, a word which in ancient Greek meant vagabonds, because they wondered aimless through the night sky without any apparent rhyme or reason. Or so it would seem if Earth was the center of the universe. The planetary patterns are very predictable when seen as revolving around the sun. Two centuries before, Pythagoras of Samos (Grecian) founded the Pythagorean school in Italy in the 6th century BC which came to speculated the planets revolved around the sun, as the sun revolved around a fiery center of the cosmos. Pythagoreans first revealed the formula for the right triangle that set off a revolution in trigonometry, navigation and the evolution of change. Pythagoreans viewed the plurality of number as the cause of all natural phenomena. While space and time consisted of points or instants, space and time also had a property called continuity of change which eventually led to introduction of the time-space continuum by the German scientist Hermann Minkowski in 1908. 

<P align = justify>Zeno of Elea was a student of Parmenides and both belonged to the Eleatic school which believed in the unity and permanence of being. Together they traveled to Athens for a visit where Zeno used a dialectic style to present his paradoxes. The most famous of which are Dichotomy, Achilles and  Arrow.  Dichotomy  argues that before a moving object can travel a given distance it must first travel half the distance; before half, a fourth; before fourth, an eight; and so on through an infinite number of distances. It is impossible to cover an infinite number of divisions in a finite time, therefore the beginning of motion is impossible. If Achilles races against a slow tortoise who has been given a head start, Achilles can never pass the tortoise because no matter how fast Achilles runs the tortoise will always be a bit ahead of him; therefore change in position is impossible. The Arrow argues that an object in flight always occupies a space equal to itself, but that which occupies a space equal to itself is not in motion; therefore motion is an illusion. Today the resolution comes in the adding all the fractions 1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+... together to get the limit of the infinite sum which converges to 1 so motion is possible.

<P align = justify>As the years rolled by, Aristotle could see no changes in the heavens. The planets continued to be unruly, as the sun remained constant as the giver of light, as cats continued to be cats; dogs, dogs; men, men and women, women. And so based upon observation, Aristotle proclaimed the heavens and all patterns set in the beginning by the heavens as timeless. The Greeks not only saw Earth as the center, but Greece as the center of the Earth, which in turn would make them center of the cosmos. Apollo's temple at Delphi had a rounded stone, Apollo's priests proclaimed as the very navel of the Earth. Only humans experienced time and as such were capable of falling from grace destroying that which was set in the beginning, but such changes were never for the better. 

<P align = justify>Ironically enough, the word heaven began in honor of the women Hatshepsut, a Pharaoh of Egypt, the first great women of power in recorded history in the 14th century B.C., who like the Pharaohs before and after, were seen as descendants of the Gods. It was rumored, however, that her nephew Thutmose III, heir to the throne, impatient of having to wait his turn; had her killed. The Greeks picked up the martyred Pharaoh  and made her Hera, Goddess of Heaven. The early stories of perfection, The Garden of Eden from which man fell, originally came from the Tigris Euphrates river valley. Perhaps such a lush valley was always being overrun by invaders and each time was a loss of Eden. Abraham of Ur originated in this fertile valley before he moved to what was soon to be called Israel. The early Greek myths, however, are more like the Egyptian myths about bringing order out of chaos. Aristotle was adopting a middle east view point when he choose to believe in perfection. Though I personally wonder, if the Greek saints embellished the first chapters of Genesis to make it sound like their Greek Aristotle. So in the end they were the same.
 
<P align = justify>There was nothing new in Aristotle's view of universe to have fascinated the middle eastern Persians who already had such myths, even if they had heard of Aristotle. There is another possible answer for the Persian fascination with the Greeks. For the previous four hundred years, the Greeks had been hosting the Olympic games in the name of Zeus, their father God. Perhaps the Persians were more interested in playing games than in fighting wars. But if the beginnings of interracial games was so powerful why was Alexander a king, instead of democratic leader? While Athens was the birthplace of democracy, it was also the home of Aristotle, Alexander the Great's teacher. Plato was Aristotle's teacher. Plato was upset when his teacher Socrates, who had adoptive Zeno's dialectic style of telling paradoxes, was sentenced to death by an Athenian democratic jury. According to Plato, Socrates, in the market place of Athens, had taught the importance of listening to one's inner voice to find one's inner truth. This upset the priests of Athena's temple who feared Socrates would become more powerful and take away their followers. The priests incited the people to put Socrates to death for insulting their city and its temple. After Socrates death, Plato took it upon himself to chastise Athens for their cruel behavior and insist upon freedom of speech. Plato, however, did not trust democracies and taught that a righteous king who cared for his citizens was the best of all possible governments. 

<P align = justify>Plato taught Aristotle. Aristotle taught Alexander the child who would become King of an extensive Greek empire. Alexander's new capital was Alexandria in Egypt. It was in Alexandria, the geometer Euclid in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, combined the knowledge of Egyptian building with Greek theory, to become the father of scientific reasoning and theoretical geometry. Euclid, however, remained silent on the nature of the solar system. Alexandria flourished as an intellectual capital until it fell victim to the Christians. At the turn of the 5th century, a women mathematician and inventor named Hypatia lectured in the Museum founded by Euclid. She claimed to be a neo-Platonist, a pagan and a follower of Pythagorean works. She was dragged by a mob of Christian monks into their church where she was killed as they scraped her flesh from her bones and her flesh burnt. Orestes, a former student of Hypatia and at the time of her death, the Roman Prefect of Alexandria; demanded an investigation. The investigation never took place. Orestes resigned and left Alexandria. Interest in science diminished until the plague ravished Europe in the 14th century.

<H3><HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="100%">    
Nicolaus Copernicus - Present</H3>

<P align = justify>The Christian God was in his heavens and all was right with the world in Europe when the plague struck in 1348, killing an estimated one-third of its population in its initial attack; reoccuring every 17 to 25 years usually in urban centers for the next four centuries. For the devoutly religious, the plague was attributed to the will of God as punishment for sin and the response was to appeal for divine intervention by means of religious processions, offerings and self-denial. Heretics, witches, Jews and others of questionable character were frequently persecuted during an outbreak of the plague. Scientific theory interested in physical causes reemerged from the dark ages to explain the biological causes of the plague. By about 1500, the theory of contagion was introduced and case studies where isolation practices were followed seemed to confirm theories of the person-to-person spread of the disease. It wasn't until the 1890's, that the ecological trio of rodent host, flea vector, and <I>Y. pestis</I> was understood, thanks to the discovery of "germs" by Louis Pasteur in France in the previous decade.

<P align = justify>Science was insisting upon the truth of our physical existence even though such truths may challenge our emotional security. In the 16th century Nicolaus Copernicus in his youth, observed an eclipse by the moon of the star Aldebaran in 1497 and wondered about Aristotle's changeless universe. Copernicus had seen an irregular change in the heavens which lead him to muse on the retrograde paths of the planets. In the sunset of his life, in 1543, he published his book <I>The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres</I> expanding upon the Pythagorean heliocentric model. Copernicus theorized that  the earth rotates daily on its axis and revolves yearly around the sun in a circular orbit as do the other planets. Science was again fascinated by heliocentric/geocentric argument  and many scientists set out to prove or disprove it.

<P align = justify>In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII introduced our current calendar which accounts for leap year every four years, including the three we skip on the beginning of each century on three out of four centuries. After Gregory's leadership ended in 1585, Copernicus ideas were meet with opposition by religious leader who felt it  was their duty to console their followers with the faith that the Earth and its human inhabitants were at the center of the universe. The philosopher Giordano Bruno, influenced by 15th century humanism, neo-Platonism and Copernican theories expounded the primacy of the intellect, the naturalness of religion and the infinity of the universe, was condemned for heresy in Rome by the Inquisition under the leadership of Pope Clement VIII. He refused to recant and was burned at the stake on Feb. 17, 1600. 

<P align = justify>Undaunted, Johannes Kepler, the imperial mathematician in Prague, in the 1609 published <I>Celestial Mechanics</I>. Using a detailed mathematical analysis, based on a life-time of astronomical observations by Tycho Brahe, Kepler proved that Mars revolved around the sun and extended his proof to theorize that all the planets revolved around the sun. Kepler realized that an ellipse (an elongated circle) gave 5% greater accuracy with observed observations than a circular orbit. He also suggested that the attraction between sun and planets diminished inversely with the distance of the planet from the sun. In Italy, in 1632, Galileo Galilei published <I>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</I> using conceptual arguments based on many of his own experiments, that contrary to Aristotle, heaven and earth are composed of the same kinds of matter. To reconcile the earth's motion based on Kepler's proof with man's experience in everyday life, Galileo set forth the concept of the relativity of motion (Einstein), the idea of inertia, the law of uniform acceleration and its application to falling bodies (Newton), calling for a unified science of physics and astronomy. Galileo was tried by the Inquisition closely guided by Pope Urban VIII, whose verdict along with Catholic church authorities was encouraged by academic followers of Aristotle, for heresy. Galileo would have been burnt alive as a heretic, but choose to rescind his beliefs and died under house arrest. Pope John Paul II, in 1992, acknowledged it was a mistake to have tried Galileo. 

<P align = justify>Enter Isaac Newton, the father of determinism, where nature plays out on a regular time table like a clock with his Laws of Motion and Gravity. But is nature the consistent clock or is it human's approximations that gives us rhythmic time. Newton thought he was born on December 25, 1642, but England was into all things Protestants so they didn't adopted Gregorian calendar until 1752. Readjusting for leap year, Newton was born on January 4, 1643. Calendars have always been such a strange issue. There are 365.2422 sidereal days in a year, a year measures the time it takes the sun to return to its original position in the heavens after one revolution around the sun and a sidereal day an even division of the year; contrasted with 365 solar days in a year, a solar day measuring the time it takes the earth to complete one rotation. Time is discontinuous when different velocities are compared, so keeping the vernal (spring) equinox on the same day of the calendar has been a challenge. Trusting in the Zodiac to measure the seasons was often more reliable.  We currently only have to add a day on leap year every four years, minus three leap years in four centuries to keep count. We skipped leap year on the years 1700, 1800, 1900, but we will be keeping leap year in the year 2000.

<P align = justify>Even the myths that surround Newton's origins and discoveries, such as the apple that fell in his garden that lead to his discovery of gravity, which Newton himself encouraged perhaps to hide the fact that Robert Hooke had previously provided a conceptual link between central attraction and a force falling off inversely with the square of the distance, are distorted. The story is told that Edmund Halley, a friend of Hooke, asked Newton what type of curve does a planet describe in its orbit around the sun, assuming an inverse square law of attraction. Newton successfully showed Halley that one could derive an ellipse.  Halley was so impressed he agreed to finance Newton's now famous <I>Naturalis Principia Mathematicia</I> in 1687. The way one derives an ellipse with an inverse square law is to draw two parabolas (half an ellipse) and connect them, but placement of the tip of the parabola depends on observed data. The algebraic equation of an ellipse, that doesn't require patching two parabolas together, requires two foci and we only have one sun. With Newton's patchwork we can derive with <I>varying degrees of accuracy </I> the orbits of the planets. Einstein improved on calculation of the orbits of planets such as Mercury that are closer to the sun, while Einstein's and Newton's method are equally reliable for planets farther away such as Pluto.

<P align = justify>Edmund Halley published his important study of cometary orbits, <I>Synopsis Astronomiae Cometicae</I>, in 1705. In it he analyzed available observations of comets in accordance with Newtonian mechanics and predicted that comets made elongated elliptical orbits around the sun. In particular he forecast that a comet he observed in 1682 would return in 1758. The comet, which now bears his name, did return after Halley's death and further convinced skeptics of the power of Newtonian mechanics, but the comet follows a strange elongated ellipse the defies simple rules of gravity attraction. In the 20th century when Richardson was measuring the coast of England, he decided that there must be more than two dimensions to all the curves along the coastline. Chaos theory agrees. A smooth ball or box would be an exact three dimensions. Mountains and valleys in a planet's surface create more than three dimensions, but less than four. The suns, planets, asteroids belts, etc with 3+ (fractal) dimensions and various densities fold space so that a comet could ride on the manifolds like a ship on an ocean current. NASA is currently mapping a host of manifolds that exist naturally in our solar system. They are hoping that spaceships can ride these space currents to save fuel. 

<P align = justify>Enter Einstein's <I>Special Theory of Relativity</I> in 1905 that suggests an inverse relationship between speed and time. In order to explain why light did not degrade, Einstein suggested that at the speed of light the time between the ticks of the clock was infinite so time ceased to exist. As velocity slowed the clock started ticking, with the slower the velocity the faster the ticks. Edwin Hubble observations in 1929 showed the universe was expanding and the time dependence of the Hubble coefficient implied an early period of rapid expansion named the Big Bang. This could reconfirmed Einstein's theory since as the earth slowed we gained extra days on leap year. However, relativity has maintains a neighbor to neighbor connection on the large scale that does not account for the sudden appearance of an extra day. Discontinuous time is obvious when comparing solar days with sidereal years. If we focus on seconds that maintain consistency with sidereal days, then solar days would become inconsistent so that by the end of the first year midnight would be come 6 AM, the end of the second year midnight would be noon, the third 6 PM and finally back to midnight again. We choose instead to focus on days and let the years be inconsistent. There are both continuous to themselves, but the inability to maintain two focuses at once confirms the Heisenberg principle of uncertainly extended to include varying velocities. 

<P align = justify>Werner Heisenberg was a German atomic physicist who in 1927 introduced the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that stated position and velocity cannot be precisely determined at the same time. Previous  Bohr, in 1913, theorized discrete atomic spectral emission lines were caused by a quantum jump where electrons jump from one permitted energy level to another of lower energy emitting a quantum of energy equal to the difference in energy between the higher and lower energy levels. When electrons jump from a lower to a higher energy level they absorb a quantum of energy. Heisenberg uncertainty principle allowed the use of probability theory in quantum theory to determine the outcome of the spectral lines. In the 1940s, George Gamow and his collaborators suggested the center of the universe may have been as hot and dense as the interior of a star and nuclear reactions would have occurred. Eventually this lead to the suggestion of cold, dark, densely packed subatomic matter that as it increased in density became hot enough to explode. Perhaps in the explosion there might be primordial cold matter made by the collapse of irregularities in the very early stages of the universe. Primordial cold matter would glow white hot emitting radiation in the form of X rays and gamma rays. The Hubble telescope has successfully detected this radiation at the center of galaxies. So where do we go from here. Will the Big Bang become the Big Crunch? See <a href="spiral.html">Cosmic Spirals</a>

This 1892 Childe Hassam painting illustrates the <strong><span style="color:#000099;">mother</span></strong> of a botanist in her garden on Appledore Island (Isles of Shoals), off the coast of Maine. She was an important American poet, and is the subject of a most interesting webpage concerning her style of dress in a circa </span><a href="http://seacoastnh.com/arts/please062003.html"><span style="color:#990000;">1858 CDV</span></a><span style="color:#3333ff;"> at which time she may have been pregnant with the botanist in question. Our fellow was born in Newton, Massachusetts. His mother was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She is the subject of many </span><a href="http://tinyurl.com/42t9f"><span style="color:#990000;">webpages</span></a><span style="color:#3333ff;">.<br /></span></div><div align="left"><span style="color:#3333ff;"></span></div><div align="left"><span style="color:#3333ff;"></span></div><div align="left"><span style="color:#3333ff;"></span></div><div align="left"><br /><span style="color:#3333ff;">Click </span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/124/1156/640/thaxter.jpg"><span style="color:#990000;">here</span></a><span style="color:#3333ff;"> to see a 1919 letter from her son to University of Connecticut botanist </span><a href="http://www.advance.uconn.edu/1998/980126/012698hs.htm"><span style="color:#990000;">George Safford Torrey</span></a><span style="color:#3333ff;">. The letter mentions the Entomophthora, a favorite group of our subject. He also was expert on the Laboulbeniales. He studied at Harvard under William Gilson Farlow, and after a brief sojourn in plant pathology at the University of Connecticut returned to the Harvard faculty in 1891. This letter was written during his first year of retirement from the active faculty at Harvard, and displays his new title of "Professor-Emeritus and Honorary Curator of the Herbarium and Laboratories of Cryptogamic Botany". He has been called the greatest mycologist of his time (<em><span style="font-size:85%;">Mycologia 25:69-89, 1933</span></em>). This seems to be an example of hereditary excellence - by no means </span><span style="color:#3333ff;">a unique case in the botanical world (DeCandolle, Michaux, Hooker, Bessey, Eaton, J.W. Bailey, to name but a few); although the fact that their high achievements were in such different disciplines is unusual. </span></div><div align="left"><span style="color:#3333ff;"><br />Click </span><a href="http://www.huh.harvard.edu/libraries/Farlowexhibit/thaxter.html"><span style="color:#990000;">here</span></a><span style="color:#3333ff;"> for some additional biographical information and a photograph. </span></div><div align="center"></div><div align="center"></div>

<span style="color:#000099;">Here is a New Year's greeting from Harvard botanist and Asa Gray protÃ©gÃ©, <a href="http://www.famousamericans.net/georgelincolngoodale/"><span style="color:#cc6600;">George Lincoln Goodale</span></a>, to <a href="http://47.1911encyclopedia.org/N/NO/NORTON_CHARLES_ELIOT.htm"><span style="color:#cc6600;">Charles Eliot Norton</span></a> from 1896. He thanks Norton for the paper by Edouard Piette (1827-1906), probably his <em>Les plantes cultivÃ©es de la pÃ©riode de transition au Mas d&#8217;Azil</em> which appeared in <strong>l&#8217;Anthropologie</strong>, vii, no. 1 1896. Mas d'Azil is the paleolithic cave site in the Pyrenees excavated by Piette. Goodale is perhaps best known for having been instrumental in bringing the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants to the Botanical Museum of Harvard.</span><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/124/1156/640/goodale.1.jpg"><img style="BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/124/1156/400/goodale.1.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-size:85%;color:#990000;">Click on image to enlarge</span></div><div align="center"><br /><br /><span style="font-family:lucida grande;"><strong><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:130%;color:#ff0000;">BEST WISHES FOR A HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM HISTORICA BOTANICA!</span> </strong></span></div><br />

	<div class="springerHTML">The <em>Journal of the History of Biology</em> is devoted to the history of the biological sciences, with additional interest and concern in philosophical and social issues confronting biology. While all historical epochs are welcome, particular attention has been paid in recent years to developments during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The journal serves both the working biologist who needs a full understanding to the historical and philosophical bases of the field and the historian of biology interested in following developments in the biological sciences.</div>

His system for naming, ranking, and classifying organisms is still in wide use today (with many changes). Hisideas on classification have influenced generations of biologists duringand after his own lifetime, even those opposed to the philosophicaland theological roots of his work.<P><hr><H3>Biography of Linnaeus</H3>He was born on May 23, 1707, at Stenbrohult, in the province ofSm&aring;land in southern Sweden. His father,Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus, was both an avid gardener and a Lutheran pastor,and Carl showed a deep love of plants and a fascination with their names from avery early age. Carl disappointed his parents by showing neither aptitude nordesire for the priesthood, but his family was somewhat consoled whenLinnaeus entered the University of Lund in 1727 to study medicine. A yearlater, he transferred to the University of Uppsala, the most prestigiousuniversity in Sweden. However, its medical facilities had been neglected andhad fallen into disrepair. Most of Linaeus's time at Uppsala was spentcollecting and studying <a href="/plants/plantae.html">plants</a>, his true love. At the time, training inbotany was part of the medical curriculum, for every doctor had toprepare and prescribe drugs derived from medicinal plants. Despite being inhard financial straits, Linnaeus mounted a botanical and ethnographical expedition to Lapland in 1731 (the portrait above showsLinnaeus as a young man, wearing a version of the traditional Lappcostume and holding a shaman's drum). In 1734 he mounted another expedition to central Sweden. <P>Linnaeus went to the Netherlands in 1735, promptly finished his medical degree at theUniversity of Harderwijk, and then enrolled in the University of Leiden forfurther studies. That same year, he published the first edition of hisclassification of living things, the <i>Systema Naturae</i>. During theseyears, he met or corresponded with Europe's great botanists, and continuedto develop his classification scheme. Returning to Sweden in 1738, he practicedmedicine (specializing in the treatment of syphilis) and lectured in Stockholm before being awarded a professorship at Uppsala in 1741. At Uppsala, he restored the University's botanical garden (arranging the plants according to his system of classification), made three more expeditions to various parts of Sweden, and inspired a generation of students. He was instrumentalin arranging to have his students sent out on trade and exploration voyages to all parts of the world: nineteen of Linnaeus's students went out on these voyages of discovery. Perhaps his most famous student, Daniel Solander, was the naturalist onCaptain James Cook's first round-the-world voyage, and brought back the first plant collections from Australia and the South Pacific to Europe. Anders Sparrman,another of Linnaeus's students, was a botanist on Cook's second voyage. Another student, Pehr Kalm, traveled in the northeastern American colonies for three years studying American plants.Yet another, Carl Peter Thunberg, was the first Western naturalist to visit Japan in over a century; he not only studied the flora of Japan, but taught Western medicineto Japanese practicioners. Still others of his students traveled to South America, southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many died on their travels.<P><a href="/history/images/systema.jpg"><img ALIGN=right HSPACE=5 src="/history/images/systemasmall.jpg" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=193></a>Linnaeus continued to revise his <i>Systema Naturae</i>, which grew from a slim pamphlet to a multivolume work, as his concepts were modified and as more and more plant and animal specimens were sent to him from every corner of the globe.(The image at right shows his scientific description of the human species from the ninth edition of <i>Systema Naturae</i>.  At the time he referred to humanity as <i>Homo diurnis</i>, or "man of the day". Click on the image to see an enlargement.) Linnaeus was also deeply involved with ways to make the Swedish economy more self-sufficient and less dependent on foreign trade, either by acclimatizing valuable plantsto grow in Sweden, or by finding native substitutes. Unfortunately, Linnaeus'sattempts to grow cacao, coffee, tea, bananas, rice, and mulberries proved unsuccessfulin Sweden's cold climate. His attempts to boost the economy (and to prevent the faminesthat still struck Sweden at the time) by finding native Swedish plants that could beused as tea, coffee, flour, and fodder were also not generally successful. He still found time to practice medicine, eventuallybecoming personal physician to the Swedish royal family. In 1758 he bought the manor estate of Hammarby, outside Uppsala, where he built a smallmuseum for his extensive personal collections. In 1761 he wasgranted nobility, and became Carl von Linn&eacute;. His later years weremarked by increasing depression and pessimism. Lingering on for several yearsafter suffering what was probably a series of mild strokes in 1774, he died in 1778. His son, also named Carl, succeeded to his professorship at Uppsala, but never was noteworthy as a botanist. When Carl the Younger died five years later with noheirs, his mother and sisters sold the elder Linnaeus's library, manuscripts, andnatural history collections to the English natural historian Sir James Edward Smith,who founded the Linnean Society of London to take care of them.<hr><P><H3>Linnaeus's Scientific Thought</H3>Linnaeus loved nature deeply, and always retained a sense of wonder at the world of livingthings. His religious beliefs led him to natural theology, a school of thoughtdating back to Biblical times but especially flourishing around 1700:since God has created the world, it is possible to understand God's wisdom bystudying His creation. As he wrote in thepreface to a late edition of <i>Systema Naturae</i>: <i>Creationis telluris estgloria Dei ex opere Naturae per Hominem solum</i> -- The Earth's creation isthe glory of God, as seen from the works of Nature by Man alone. The study of nature would reveal the Divine Order ofGod's creation, and it was the naturalist's task to construct a "naturalclassification" that would reveal this Order in the universe. <P>However, Linnaeus's plant taxonomy was based solely on the number and arrangement of the reproductive organs; a plant's class was determined by itsstamens (male organs), and its order by its pistils (female organs). This resulted inmany groupings that seemed unnatural. For instance, Linnaeus's Class Monoecia,Order Monadelphia included plants with separate male and female "flowers" on thesame plant (Monoecia) and with multiple male organs joined onto onecommon base (Monadelphia). This order included conifers such as pines, firs, and cypresses (the distinction between true flowers and conifer cones was not clear), but also included a few true flowering plants, such as the castor bean. "Plants"without obvious sex organs were classified in the  Class Cryptogamia, or "plants with a hidden marriage," which lumped together the algae, <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichens.html">lichens</a>, <a href="/fungi/fungi.html">fungi</a>, <a href="/plants/bryophyta/bryophyta.html">mosses</a> and other bryophytes, and <a href="/plants/pterophyta/pteridopsida.html">ferns</a>. Linnaeus freely admitted that this produced an "artificialclassification," not a natural one, which would take into account all thesimilarities and differences between organisms. But like many naturalists ofthe time, in particular <a href=/history/Edarwin.html>Erasmus Darwin</a>,Linnaeus attached great significance to plant sexual reproduction, which hadonly recently been rediscovered. Linnaeus drew some rather astonishingparallels between plant sexuality and human love: he wrote in 1729 how<blockquote>The flowers' leaves. . . serve as bridal beds which the Creator has sogloriously arranged, adorned with such noble bed curtains, and perfumed with so many soft scents that the bridegroom with his bride might therecelebrate their nuptials with so much the greater solemnity. . . </blockquote>The sexual basis of Linnaeus's plant classification was controversial in its day;although easy to learn and use, it clearly did not give good results in many cases.Some critics also attacked it for its sexually explicit nature: one opponent, botanistJohann Siegesbeck, called it "loathsome harlotry". (Linnaeus had his revenge,however; he named a small, useless European weed <i>Siegesbeckia</i>.) Later systems of classification largely follow<a href=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/ray.html>John Ray's</a> practiceof using morphological evidence from all parts of the organism in allstages of its development. What has survived of the Linnean system is itsmethod of hierarchical classification and custom of binomial nomenclature.<P>For Linnaeus, species of organisms were realentities, which could be grouped into higher categories called <b>genera</b>(singular, <b>genus</b>). By itself, this was nothing new; since Aristotle,biologists had used the word genus for a group of similar organisms, and thensought to define the <i>differentio specifica</i> -- the specific differenceof each type of organism. But opinion varied on how genera should begrouped. Naturalists of the day often used arbitrary criteria to group organisms, placingall domestic animals or all water animals together. Part of Linnaeus'innovation was the grouping of genera into higher taxa that were also based onshared similarities. In Linnaeus's original system, genera were grouped intoorders, orders into classes, and classes into kingdoms. Thus the kingdomAnimalia contained the class Vertebrata, which contained the order Primates,which contained the genus <i>Homo</i> with the species <i>sapiens</i> --humanity. Later biologists added additional ranks between these to expressadditional levels of similarity.<P>Before Linnaeus, species naming practices varied. Manybiologists gave the species they described long, unwieldy Latin names,which could be altered at will; a scientist comparing two descriptions ofspecies might not be able to tell which organisms were being referred to.For instance, the common wild briar rose was referred to by differentbotanists as <i>Rosa sylvestris inodora seu canina</i> and as<i>Rosa sylvestris alba cum rubore, folio glabro</i>.The need for a workable naming system was made even greater by the hugenumber of plants and animals that were being brought back to Europe fromAsia, Africa, and the Americas. After experimenting with various alternatives,Linnaeus simplified naming immensely by designating one Latin name to indicatethe genus, and one as a "shorthand" name for the species. The two names makeup the <b>binomial</b> ("two names") species name. Forinstance, in his two-volume work <i>Species Plantarum</i> (<i>The Species ofPlants</i>), Linnaeus renamed the briar rose <i>Rosa canina</i>.This binomial system rapidly became the standard system for naming species.Zoological and most botanical taxonomic priority begin with Linnaeus: theoldest plant names accepted as valid today are those published in <i>SpeciesPlantarum</i>, in 1753, while the oldest animal names are those in the tenthedition of <i>Systema Naturae</i> (1758), the first edition to usethe binomial system consistently throughout. Although Linnaeus was not the first to use binomials, he was the first to use them consistently, and for this reason, Latin names that naturalists used before Linnaeus are not usually considered valid under the rules of nomenclature.<P>In his early years, Linnaeus believed that the species was not only real,but unchangeable -- as he wrote, <i>Unitas in omni specie ordinem ducit</i>(The invariability of species is the condition for order [in nature]). ButLinnaeus observed how different species of plant might hybridize, to createforms which looked like new species. He abandoned the concept that specieswere fixed and invariable, and suggested that some -- perhaps most --species in a genus might have arisen after the creation of the world, through hybridization. In his attempts to grow foreign plants in Sweden, Linnaeus also theorized that plant species might be altered through the processof acclimitization. Towards the end of his life, Linnaeus investigatedwhat he thought were cases of crosses between genera, and suggested that,perhaps, new genera might also arise through hybridization.<P>Was Linnaeus an evolutionist? It is true that he abandoned his earlierbelief in the fixity of species, and it is true that hybridization has producednew species of plants, and in some cases of animals. Yet to Linnaeus,the process of generating new species was not open-ended and unlimited.Whatever new species might have arisen from the <i>primae speciei</i>, the original species in the Garden of Eden, were still part ofGod's plan for creation, for they had always potentially been present.Linnaeus noticed the struggle for survival -- he once called Nature a"butcher's block" and a "war of all against all". However, he considered struggle and competition necessary to maintain the balanceof nature, part of the Divine Order. The concept of open-ended evolution, notnecessarily governed by a Divine Plan and with no predetermined goal, neveroccurred to Linnaeus; the idea would have shocked him. Nevertheless, Linnaeus's hierarchical classification and binomial nomenclature,much modified, have remained standard for over 200 years. Hiswritings have been studied by every generation of naturalists, including<a href=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html>Erasmus Darwin</a>and Charles Darwin. The search for a "natural system" of classificationis still going on -- except that what systematists try to discover and useas the basis of classification is now the evolutionary relationships of taxa.<hr><P>The <a href="http://linnaeus.nrm.se/botany/fbo/welcome.html.en">Linn&eacute; Herbarium</a>, at the<a href=http://www.nrm.se/>Swedish Museum of Natural History</a>,preserves some of Linnaeus's original plant specimens.

<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>Dr. Albert Hofmann, the brilliant Swiss chemist, philosopher, author, and retired Director of the Pharmaceutical-Chemical Research Laboratories of Sandoz Ltd., Basel, is best known for fathering his &quot;problem child,&quot; LSD, on April 19, 1943. Thirteen years later, a brief article in a local paper caught his eye. The article stated that a researcher from America had traveled to southern Mexico and participated in a native ritual where mushrooms were consumed that produced strange visions. Already intimately acquainted with the molecular structures of the known psychedelics, Dr. Hofmann was curious about the chemical constituency of the mushrooms. The researcher was, of course, R. Gordon Wasson, but his name was not mentioned in the article and Dr. Hofmann would remain interested in the mysterious mushrooms.</FONT><P>
<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>A year later Dr. Hofmann was contacted by Professor Roger Heim, esteemed French mycologist and Director of the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, who requested his assistance in carrying out the chemical investigations of the sacred Mexican mushrooms. Roger Heim had accompanied R. Gordon Wasson on his 1956 expedition to Huautla de Jimenez and identified and named several of the species used by the Mazatecs in their divinatory and curing rites. His beautiful watercolor renderings of sacred Psilocybes accompanied Wasson's <I>Life</I> article in 1957.</FONT><P>
<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>Dr. Hofmann enthusiastically accepted Heim's invitation and quickly began the arduous task of isolating the active principles. Also at about this time, unknown to Dr. Hofmann, James Moore -- who had claimed to be a chemist from the University of Delaware -- was working to isolate the mushrooms' actives. His intentions, however, were different from those of Dr. Hofmann's.</FONT><P>
<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>In 1956, Moore, who was in reality a CIA operative specializing in the synthesis of psychoactive and chemical weapons for the CIA, offered R. Gordon Wasson a $2,000 grant from the agency's front group, The Geschikter Foundation, and invited himself along on Wasson's next expedition. Wasson, like Dr. Hofmann, had no idea as to Moore's true identity. Moore was hoping to obtain samples of the mushrooms, isolate their active principles and provide the CIA with some new &quot;mind-control&quot; toys.</FONT><P>

<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>Fortunately, Moore's efforts were unsuccessful and the honor, deservedly, went to Dr. Hofmann. Working with 100 dried grams of the mushroom <A HREF="http://www.stainblue.com/mexicana.html"><I><B>Psilocybe mexicana</B></I></A>, which Heim had provided from artificial cultures grown skillfully in his lab, Dr. Hofmann isolated and named the active compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Chemically they are 4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine and 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Dr. Hofmann's results were subsequently published in the March 1958 issue of <I>Experientia.</I></FONT><P>

<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>Dr. Hofmann quickly succeeded at finding the synthetic routes to psilocybin and psilocin along with their analogs, 4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine (the diethyl analog of psilocybin) and 4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine (the diethyl analog of psilocin). These compounds were designated CEY-19 and CZ-74 <B>[Figure 1]</B>. In clinical trials conducted in Europe, these agents showed promise when used as an adjunct to psychotherapy, differing only in a shorter and more manageable duration of action.</FONT><P>

<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>Interestingly, in 1962 Dr. Hofmann accompanied R.

A <I>velada</I> was arranged and Dr. Hofmann presented her with a vial of synthetic psilocybin pills which he had produced in his Sandoz lab. Near dawn, when the ceremony ended, Maria declared the pills &quot;the same spirit as the mushrooms,&quot; and thanked Dr. Hofmann, saying she could now &quot;serve my people even during the season when no mushrooms grow.&quot;</FONT><P>
<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>Now in his 90s, Dr. Hofmann resides in Switzerland, and is a member of the Nobel Prize Committee.</FONT><P>

The amounts of these compounds present in the mushrooms are highly variable, with <I>Psilocybe cubensis</I> -- one of the most active species -- typically yielding up to 1.3% psilocybin and up to .25--.60% psilocin per dried gram.</FONT><P>

<FONT="Times New Roman" SIZE=4>Psilocybin and psilocin are noteworthy in that their molecular structures are very similar to chemicals present in the human brain. Psilocin, for example, differs from the human neurotransmitter <A HREF="http://www-east.elsevier.com/bps/rec_iss/4403toc.htm"><B>serotonin</B></A> (designated 5-hydroxytryptamine) <B>[Figure 5]</B> by only one hydroxy molecule. In this respect, the mushrooms are mirror images of the human brain. Psilocybin is the phosphoric acid ester of psilocin and is the only known indole derivative occurring in nature that contains this novel phosphoric acid radical. The phosphoric acid is considered &quot;dead weight&quot; and does not contribute to the compound's psychedelic effects. Its presence does, however, stabilize the compound. Conversely, psilocin, which lacks this phosphoric radical, is extremely unstable and sensitive to oxidation. It is 1.4 times as active as psilocybin, a ratio corresponding to the molecular weights of the compounds. 
Psilocin is the &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; of psychedelics.</FONT><P>

      <P><B>Joseph Dalton Hooker</B> was arguably the most important British botanist 
        of the nineteenth century. A traveller and plant-collector, he was one 
        of Charles Darwin&#146;s closest friends and eventually became director 
        of Britain&#146;s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</P>
      <P>The image on the left is believed to be  the last photograph ever taken of Sir J.D. Hooker, June 3rd 1911. (&copy; The Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.).<br>

<p>Rudolf Stefan Weigl (1883-1957) has made an enormous scientific contribution to microbiology, in general, by adapting the sucking insects,  lice,  to serve as laboratory animals.    That permitted for the first propagation and studying of <i>Rickettsia prowazekii</i>, the agent of the typhus and production of the first effective vaccine against exanthematous (epidemic) typhus.  Weigl has done it before and during the WWII in his Institute of Biology at the University of Jan Kazimierz (UJK), at that time in   Lwów, Poland.  The production of this vaccine was based on   propagation of <I>Rickettsia prowazekii</I>, the microbial typhus agent, in the Weigl's strain of clothes lice, Pediculus  vestimenti.

The procedure of 1939 - 1945 consisted of:  
<br>(i) feeding of healthy lice with sucked blood, when kept in special cages placed on the skin of human 'feeders',  
<br>(ii)  infection of lice and  propagation of <I>R. prowazekii</I>  in the midgut (stomach) cells, 
<br>(iii) the dissection of louse midgut,  and  
<br>(iv) the final preparation of the 
phenolized vaccine. 
</ul>
Significance of Weigl's vaccine was enormous, both potentially and practically, at the time when it was developed just before  and during WW2.   However at present, the threat of typhus is almost not existent because of antibiotics and since lice could be very effectively controlled. Weigl's scientific heritage retains a great importance in the history of world medicine, especially in relation to the humanitarian, political  and historical  ramifications of the  very unique  and trying period in the history of Central and Eastern Europe, including Lwów and Poland, during and after WW2.

 <p>This essay is an attempt to describe Professor Weigl as the man and scientist, mainly during the period between the WWI and WWII and especially during WWII and shortly after it.  I knew Weigl rather well, as the friend of my Father, my boss, a biologist and the father of my schoolmate Turek Weigl.  The story is cast as a part of Polish life of Lwów during that period of history which is now gone, with Lwów presently converted into an Ukrainian city of Lviv, with little connection to the life in the period described in present essay.   However, the history of each city, especially of a great city like Lwów, is and should be precious, and 
the spirit of present  Lviv demands it that it should be preserved,  cherished and be a source of pride for all the present Lvovians.

Weigl was a great man, probably a genius, and much about him was highly unusual.   He was born in 1883 in Prerov, Moravia, as an Austrian with German-speaking parents. At that time there was no reason for him to become later a patriotic Lvovian and an outstanding Pole.  
The fate, however, ruled otherwise, as outlined below and based on accounts of Henryk Mosing and Stefan Krynski.   Rudolf's father, who was in charge of a transportation establishment in Olomouc, was killed when testing a new model of a bicycle, and left a widow, Elisabeth Kroesel with three small children. Elisabeth moved to Vienna with Rudolf and with two years older brother Frederyk, and four years older sister, Lilly.  There she met a Polish high school teacher, Jozef Trojnar, whom she married.   Troynars moved to Jaslo, then Stryj and finally Lwów, all in the Polish-speaking part of the Austrian occupation zone of Poland.  Growing up in the Polish environment, Rudolf Weigl has effectively chosen to become a Pole.  He enrolled at the Lwów University (Biological Sciences), being under the spell of famous biology teachers, Benedykt Dybowski (1833-1930), and J. Nusbaum-Hilarowicz (1859-1917). After graduation in 1907, he was awarded a  Privat-Docent degree in 1913 in the comparative zoology and anatomy.

   <font size=-1><p>With WWI aproaching,  he was drafted as parasitologist at the Army Laboratory in Przemysl,  and became interested in the of typhus, which at that time was spreading  through the Easter Europe.  Thus Rudolf's scientific dice was cast ! 
 <p>At that time typhus was a dreaded disease, which was killing millions and affecting world history.  As described below, Napoleon was defeated by typhus, and only in Wilno, there were buried 30 000 French victims of this  disease.  The war plans of WWI were affected by the typhus epidemics in Serbia.  Weigl realized, therefore, that his work could 
affect the World's history!

<font size=-1> Weigl knew that lice are the vector of the typhus  (Charles Nicolle received Nobel Prize for this discovery; Gross, 1996), but there was no way at that time to cultivate the typhus agent, <I>Ricketsia prowazekii</I>.  Based on finding of Brasillian aristocrat, Rocha-Lima, Weigl also knew that the Ricketsia propagates in louse intestines. Thus Weigl has decided to use lice as an experimental animal to propagate the <I>Ricketsia prowazekii</I> bacteria and in this manner to have ample material to study them and maybe to develop a life-saving  vaccine.   However, there was no way to infect the lice, other then feeding them on the typhus victim,  which was  not a practical and reproducible method.  What was needed now was the experimental genius of Weigl.  Since he was not able to infect lice either by their natural sucking manner or by contact from louse to louse,  he decided to inject a suspension of Ricketsia into the louse  anus,  using very fine glass capillary.   That worked, thanks to Weigl's  "golden hands"  and in this way the history was made.  As Weigl was quoted by Mosing,  he remarked to Prof.  Eisenberg of Kraków that  "since lice refuse to suck the Ricketsia,  I will stick those into their ass".

<p>Before the era of vaccination and  effective insect control,  the louse-transmitted typhus was one of the major infectious diseases and a cause of disastrous  epidemics.  The first successful anti-typhus vaccine was developed by Prof. Rudolf Stefan Weigl(1883-1957) at the University of Jan Kazimierz (UJK) in Lwów, Poland (Weigl,  1920, 1930a,b, 1947).  This vaccine was produced on a large scale in  Weigl's laboratory before World War II (WW2) in Lwów,  Poland,  and used in China (Rutten, 1936,1943), Ethiopia (Mariani, 1939) and other countries. Production continued during the WW2, when Lwów was occupied firstly by Stalin's  USSR, in  1939 - 1941, and then by Hitler's Germany  in  1941-1944.

<p>In early Spring of 1944, Prof. Weigl was forced to leave  Lwów and most of  his Institute was  forcibly evacuated to  Germany  by the retreating  Nazi  army  or destroyed when Lwów was re-occupied by Stalin's  USSR,  soon  afterwards annexed,  and  then  ethnically cleansed  (with USA as an effective accomplice of its Soviet ally). 
	<p>After suffering waves of occupations, by Soviet Union  (1939 - 1941), by Nazi Germany (1941 - 1944), and  re-occupation by USSR in 1944,  the Polish  population of Lwów (at the beginning of WW2, the Polish  citizenry of  Lwów  consisted of about 60-70% Roman-catholics,  20-30%  Mosaic (Jewish)  and 10%  Armenian-catholic,  Greek-catholic,  Lutheran and others), if  not liquidated earlier or deported to Siberia, was forcibly evacuated  to the Western  Poland, mainly  Silesia.

	<p>As described above, Prof. Weigl had to  leave his beloved city  of  Lwów,  and he then moved to Kroscienko nad Dunajcem,  where he  established a small laboratory,  then to Kraków  (Cracow)  as Professor of General Microbiology at the Jagiellonian University (1945-1948), and finally to the University of Poznan (1948-1951).  After retirement, he died in Zakopane, Poland, in 1957, reaching only 74 years of age (Krynski, 1967a,b, 1997;  Nespiak  and  Ojrzynski,  1994;  Stuchly, 1994).
	<p>Weigl's accomplishments and  procedures for adapting an insect,  louse,  as an experimental laboratory animal,  and  applying it in the production  an  anti-typhus  vaccine are described below.

	<p>To produce Weigl's anti-typhus vaccine, the typhus-causing microorganisms, <I>Rickettsia prowazekii</I>, were propagated in the midgut  (stomach) cells of live lice and were killed by 0.5% phenol.  The individual stages of the vaccine production, as based on my recollections in conjunction with a detailed and scholarly account in the monograph  of Krynski et al. (1974),  were as follows:
<P>&nbsp;
	<p><b>(1)	Production of healthy lice

<P>&nbsp;
		<p>(a)  Louse  strains</b>

<p>The major accomplishment of Prof. R.  Weigl was the introduction of an insect, louse, as the experimental  animal,  for the purpose of propagation of <I>R. prowazekii</I>.    He has 'engineered' a special strain of lice, named Pediculus vestimenti, which was easy to breed,  and was well adapted to the production of typhus vaccine.   The strain was a  Caucasus-African cross between lice isolated from the WW1   Russian prisoners (captured by Austrians) and  Ethiopian lice received  in 1939  by Weigl from the Laboratory for Rickettsiosis  in Addis Ababa.  This cross was designated as  "Weigl strain"   (Krynski et al. 1974;  Mariani, 1939).

Reasons for cultivating <I>R. prowazekii</I>  in  lice were manifold:
	
<br>(i)  At that time no suitable artificial media existed for cultivation of <I>R. prowazekii</I>,
<br>(ii)  Subsequently proposed propagation of <I>R. prowazekii</I> in hen eggs  resulted in the inadvertent selection of progressively less immunogenic  variants of <I>R. prowazekii</I>,   and
<br>(iii)   Cultivation and passaging of  <I>R.  prowazekii</I>   in the midgut of Weigl's strain of lice (<I>Pediculus  vestimenti</I>   or <I>Pediculus humanus</I> corporis) was  resulting in the most potent and  reliable anti-typhus vaccine (Krynski et al. 1974).

<p><b>(b)   Hatching of louse eggs</b>

<p> Lice were depositing eggs on small squares of woolen fabric (see below). Each square was then held by a partial constriction near the middle of a cotton-plugged glass vial (hatching tube) and incubated at 32°C.  The healthy lice larvae, which hatched after 3 to 8 days, were dropping to the bottom of the  hatching tube and the crop of 400 -  800 larvae formed a  pulsating yellowish ball of about 5 - 8  mm diameter.   Larvae were transferred to the flat (of about 4x7 cm size) cages (Sikora, 1915, 1917, 1924) only about 5 mm deep and made of wood  (for a drawing, see Krynski et al., 1974).  One wall of these cages consisted of special screen adapted by Weigl, with his usual ingenuity, from screens routinely used  for flour sifting in the Polish flour mill  industry.  Lice were able only to stick out only their heads through this screen, but were not able to escape.  About 800 larvae were placed into each cage that contained a lose small square of woolen fabric (for depositing eggs), which during WW2 was made of discarded army   uniforms,
Russian or   German.  The cages were sealed  with paraffin as to prevent escape of any tiny larvae.

<p> Depending on the size of calves or thighs,  about  7 - 11  cages were placed  screen-down on the leg of the 'feeder'.   The screen walls of the cages were pressed against the skin,  while  cages were held under a wide  garter-like elastic band.  Sticking out their heads through the screen wall,  the lice were able to  pierce the skin and suck blood for about  45 minutes, once  a  day, for about 12 days.  The 
resulting 1x2 inch  reddish marks on the skin were washed with 60% alcohol, which contained HgCl<sub>2</sub>  as the disinfectant. Feeders could tolerate well the moderate discomfort  and loss of blood (Finkel, 1932).   Between  WW1  and  WW2,  Weigl  has tried to  adapt pigs as large-scale louse feeders,  but  he did not succeed to make it practical (Weigl, 1920,  1930a,b,  and personal communication).

	<p> Men  usually were attaching the cages to their calves,  while women  placed  the cages on their  thighs  (as to hide the reddish marks under their skirts).    After the 30 - 45 minutes feeding  session, the louse gut as well as  the entire body was swelling like a balloon, since each louse was ingesting the amount of blood equal to its  entire body weight. Lice became rather dark colored (not red) with very shiny abdomens.

	<p> Cages were placed 'screen-down' in special  holding boxes,  as  to  keep lice dry and  clean,  while their    feces,
when drying out, did sift through the screen and collected
at the bottom of the holding box. The  boxes  with cages were kept in 32°C incubators.  Lice were periodically transferred (first time after six days, then more frequently) to the cleaned and  heat-sterilized cages,  each  containing a square of woolen fabric for depositing eggs (see above).  These transfers were necessary both for collecting eggs, and for removing any  dead  or unhealthy appearing lice and louse debris,  including  feces  and products of molting.  All operations were carried  out under highly aseptic conditions,  assuring that the lice colony remained healthy and free of any viruses,  bacteria or other parasites.  However, microbial epizootic infections did sometimes occur, requiring destruction of the contents of such infected cages (Krynski, 1967c;  Krynski  et al. 1974).
<p> The healthy 12-day old lice were produced by "breeding units" (hodowle), each composed of the supervisor (kierownik hodowli) and 12-15  feeders (karmiciele),  i.e., persons who fed the lice.  The author of this chapter served as a supervisor of such an unit,  and  also as  a feeder, between 1941 and 1944.  Most  of the feeders in my breeding unit were  Professors of UJK  (see the section on the Humanitarian, Historical and Political  Ramifications, below).  The entire operation  was  supervised by Dr.  Stefania  Pokorny.

	<p> The next step in the vaccine preparation was the infection of lice with <I>R. prowazekii</I> at a concentration corresponding to one  Rickettsiae-infected and fully homogenized louse midgut per ml (10<sup>6</sup>  to 10<sup>7</sup> infectious units per ml).  Cages, each containing 300 - 400 of 12-day old healthy lice, were transferred to the completely separate "injection units", where the specially trained "injectors" (strzykacze) were infecting lice  manually with <I>R.  prowazekii</I>,  and  then feeding the infected  and  caged lice for another 5 days.  The entire injection operation was highly engineered, as to make it efficient  (for details see Krynski et al.,1974).
<p> As the first step,  20 to 50 lice were immobilized in a special device (Weigl's clamp) where each louse was held by a very gentle spring clamp, while the anal segment of their abdomen was exposed and easily accessible.  These clamp devices were then placed under a 32x binocular microscope, and each louse was anally injected with a suspension of <I>R. prowazekii</I>.

	A 0.05 - 0.1 mm glass microcapillary  (with its end cut on angle and fire polished, as to avoid injury to louse anus and intestine) served as an injection device.   Propagation of  Rickettsiae  was taking place in cells which lined the louse midgut, which is straight, strong and elastic; the anal part of gut (ampulla recti) is lined with very tough chitin and thus is resistant to injury by the glass capillary.   Injection was mediated by a pulse of weak positive pressure, controlled by reducing valves,  electrically actuated solenoid valves,  and finally by the operator (injector) who was using a foot-operated pedal.  Each injection cycle consisted of the insertion of the capillary into the louse anus, briefly depressing the pedal to effect the injection, and withdrawal of the capillary; the entire cycle required about one second.  Including all the auxiliary operations, a team  of two highly skilled operators (one immobilizing  and  the second injecting the lice) was able to inject up to 2000 lice per hour.

	<p> Each batch of about 500 injected lice was then loaded into a cage, and fed  for  5  more days  by sucking  blood of the intensively vaccinated  'injectors'.  Feeding of the infected lice attested to the efficacy of Weigl's vaccine, since  no  serious typhus cases occurred among the injectors. 
	When population of <I>R. provazekii</I>  reaches 10<sup>7</sup>  per cell,  the gut cells began to burst, resulting in leakage of the undigested  and thus red human blood into the louse abdomen;  thus in the final stage of the rickettsial infection, the lice bodies were turning bright red.

	<p> Weigl's  methods for  large-scale breeding and infecting insects were quite a unique achievement, thus having an impact on other branches of experimental entomology.   E.g.,  experiments  were carried on the infection of lice by Yersinia   and Pasteurella ,  and on testing the efficacy of antibiotics on the rickettsial  infection (Becla, 1974;  Becla and  Krynski, 1972;  Krynski and  Becla, 1964;  Krynski et al., 1966);    analogous  methods were used for infecting ticks (Becla,  1974).   Moreover,  the Editor of this Manual,   Prof. Karl Maramorosch,  had adapted some of these methods for cultivation of leafhoppers  and for the  construction of the  "leafhopper clamp and injection"  device  (Maramorosch  and  Jernberg,  1970).

<p> <b>(3)	Dissection of lice and preparation of the vaccine</b>
	<p> The entire production of vaccine at  Weigl's  Institute  in  Nineteen Forties was supervised  by  Dr. J. Starzyk (Starzyk, 1938).  As the first step,  cages with the  infected lice (about 5 days after injecting  with <I>Rickettsiae</I>)  were inspected and  cleaned of feces and debris.  Those lice with  adequate crop of <I>Rickettsiae</I> ,  i.e., those that turned red,  were placed into  jars filled with 0.5% phenol,  earmarked for vaccine production,  and consequently transferred to the "dissector's  stations".   "Dissectors" (preparatorzy)  were harvesting louse guts  that   were heavily infected with <I>Rickettsiae</I>.    My younger brother, Stanislaw  Szybalski worked as a dissector,  and helped to refresh my memory   about some details described here.   Many instruments are depicted in the review of Krynski et al. (1974).  Using a fine scalpel  and under the 16x  binocular microscope, an  incision was made  between the thorax and abdomen of louse, and the Rickettsia-infected gut was pulled out using the needle and the tip of the scalpel.  Dissection of about  300 lice per hour per dissector  was  the  norm. Both ends of the gut were cut off, and the infected midguts were then transferred to the jars containing 0.5% phenol solution and  subsequently ground to a fine suspension  in the Weigl's  mortar.  Debris were then removed at 1000 rpm, the suspension   sedimented at  6000 rpm, and finaly resuspended in 0.5% phenol buffer.  The vaccine was prepared at three different strengths and  was composed  of the vaccination fluid (buffer) containing  fine emulsion 
of phenol-killed  <I>R. prowazekii</I>,  equivalents to 15, 30 and 45 louse guts.

<p>These  three  strengths  of vaccine  were  packaged and distributed in sealed glass ampoules.  At the time of my tenure at the Weigl's Institute,  the entire course of vaccination consisted of  three injections,  administered  at the increasing strength at one week intervals and amounting to a total of 90 infected louse guts. 
	<p>The vaccine was safe with exception of  sometimes serious allergic reactions,  especially  observed among the  Weigl's Institute  employees who often became sensitized  to louse  byproducts.   Personally, I have developed  asthmatic reaction to louse feces dust; moreover, I  had a very strong anaphylactic shock after the third  round of vaccination.

<p>At the time of its development, the Weigl's vaccine was the first and only remedy against the dreaded typhus epidemics.  Although at present, typhus does not appear to be of any major epidemiological importance, this disease was responsible for major epidemics and death of millions, up to the second half of the 20-th century.  The extensive epidemiological, clinical  and historical accounts could be found in the chapter of Snyder (1948).  Only a few salient features are mentioned here.  The first description of typhus is of year 1083  from a convent near Salerno, Italy, and similar accounts could also be found in the famous work of Fracastorius, "De Contagione", published in 1546.  As described by Professor Stefan Krynski, a collaborator of Prof. Weigl, in several of his articles in  1995-1998  in the Gazeta AMG Gdansk (see especially,  Krynski, 1997), the most severe epidemics of typhus usually accompanied the major wars and famines.  One of the biggest epidemics was during Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in 1812, when more  French soldiers died of typhus than from Russian bullets.  One could say that lice  have defeated Napoleon's armies;  moreover,  their retreat has spread the infected lice and  typhus  through the entire continent of Europe. Especially severe epidemics affected the Byelorussian and Lithuanian areas of the former Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom.  Typhus has contributed also to the defeat of Napoleon III in the war with Prussia, when the fortress of Metz had to surrender because of the epidemics.  During  the WW1, typhus epidemics  have  killed  150,000  Serbs  in 1915.

<p>Therefore,  the development of the first  highly effective anti-typhus vaccine by Weigl was of such a major epidemiological importance,  although his discoveries  were barely noticed in the Western  medical literature (Snyder, 1944;  Anigstein, 1947).  A total of 5 - 6 millions of individuals were vaccinated against typhus during German occupation in the eastern zone of war operations.
	<p>Weigl,  although having Austrian parents and being born in Prerov (Przerow, in Polish) in the Moravian province of the Austro-Hungarian  empire(presently in Czech Republic),  after loosing his Father early in life and moving  with his mother  and  stepfather,  a  high school principal, to the Polish cities of Jaslo,  Tarnopol,  Stryj and later to Lwów, where he attended Polish schools, became by his own choice a very patriotic Pole (A Monograph, 1994;   Krynski,  1967a,b, 1997).   His son Wiktor was my close high school friend;  Wiktor's  mother, Zofia nee  Kulikowska,  the first wife of Prof. Weigl,  was always very kind to me, as she was to all the Wiktor's  friends.  
	<p>It has been established in 1909 by Charles Nicolle of The  Pasteur Institute, Paris,  that louse was the vector for typhus.  It has  been proven in 1916 by H. da Rocha-Lima  that the infectious agent  carried by lice is <i>Rickettsia prowazekii</i>  [named after the American and Czech  investigators,   H. T.  Ricketts  and S. von Prowazek (born as Stanislav  Provazek), both of whom died of typhus when studying Rickettsiae as the etiologic agent].   Weigl  was destined to make next critical contribution to the field; being a zoologist, parasitologist, comparative anatomist, histologist, and entomologist,  and  also a  professor of biology at the University of Lwów, Poland,   he  became an expert in the biology and pathology of lice.  In the early Twenties,  feeding infected lice and testing typhus vaccine were  all done with guinea pigs (Weigl, 1920), especially since Weigl, who was not  a physician,  was reluctant to perform human experiments.  The latter were done without prior Weigl's knowledge, by a dedicated couple of technicians, Michal and Rozalia Martynowicz, who in this manner tried, however surreptitiously, to help their beloved Professor.  Michal was a typhus survivor, and thus immune, whereas his wife Rozalia was never exposed to typhus.  Without notifying his boss Prof. Weigl,  Michal has vaccinated his wife Rozalia with Weigl's vaccine, and then she agreed to feed the R. prowazekii-infected lice.  Only after both were sure that Rozalia did not contract typhus, they notified Prof. Weigl about their results. This experiment became crucial for Weigl's decision to perform large-scale vaccination trials in the regions of endemic typhus  (Chodzko,  1933;  Radlo, 1937).  The very successful results were widely reported and praised in the Polish and  World  Media.  Especially  successful was the vaccination campaign in China carried out by the Belgian missionaries (Rutten, 1936, 1943).   As  cited from the report of  Father Rutten:   "Typhus was one of the greatest human enemies killing at that time more victims then all other epidemics combined.  Of 130  Fathers active in China, 70% died of typhus in the years of 1908 to 1931."  Father Rutten wrote  further,  that:  "When news reached us, that a Polish Professor has developed a vaccine, we were first very skeptical, since many 'cures'  were proposed or sold to us before, but all of these failed.  Anyway,  we decided to try the Polish vaccine and the results turned out to be dramatic.  During the past 7 years, since we started using the Weigl's vaccine, not a single of our missionaries or of the vaccinated Chinese patients died of typhus.  Your Polish vaccine saved lives not only of missionaries but also of many thousands  of Chinese".

<p>Praises were heaped upon Prof. Weigl, including a kind statement by Charles Nicolle, a Nobel laureate, who established  that louse is the typhus'  vector;    he wrote: "The 'war'  with typhus did not appear promising, until it was joined by the brilliant Polish scientist, Professor Rudolf Weigl from Lwów, Poland. Weigl taught us how to cultivate the typhus agent in lice, and moreover,  has developed a superior vaccine, which saved many thousands of lives.  As person, Weigl deserves highest recognition, as a brilliant intellect, untiring worker and a fanatic of science" (Krynski, 1997).  
<p>	Unfortunately, the well deserved Nobel prize has eluded Weigl because of the politics and WW2.  However, he received many honors, including the Order of St. Gregory from the Pope Pius XI, the Leopold Order from the Belgian King, the Order of Polonia Restituta, and in addition he was  elected to the Polish Academy  (PAU  or  Polska Akademia  Umiejetnosci)  and many foreign Academies,   and  he became an honorary member of several scientific  societies (A  Monograph, 1994;   Krynski,  1967a,b, 1997).

<p>Most  of the methods for the cultivation of lice and production of the Weigl vaccine were developed before WW2  in the Department of Biology of the UJK in Lwów, which was then a Polish city,  with several Universities or Schools of Higher Learning,  best  characterized as a counterpart of  Boston in USA or Cambridge in  England.   

<p>It had  rich Western  and international traditions,   as reflected by its many names  (Leopolis in  Latin; Leopoli in Italian;  Lemberg in German;   Lvov in Russian; Lviv or Lwiw  in Ukrainian,  the spelling of Russian  and  Ukrainian names depending  on the transliteration).   Lwów  was a  city with about 600 years of  Polish history and  tradition  and  the  extremely patriotic Lvovian citizenry.  At the eve of WW2  in 1939,  its population of about 350,000 was a rather  homogeneous 'melt'  with various ethnic and religious  backgrounds:  predominantly (about 60-70%) Roman-catholic, about 20-30%  Mosaic (integrated  and orthodox Jewish),  the remaining  about 10% Armenian-catholic (of Armenian  origin),  Greek-catholic (predominantly of Red Rutenian or Ukrainian origin),  Lutheran (mainly Austrian or German) and others.

<p> <b>(2)  The period during and just after WW2</b>
<p>&nbsp	
<p>WW2 started on  September 1, 1939,  and as results Lwów became occupied  first by the Soviet  and later by the Nazi's Armies.   However,  Weigl's  Typhus Institute became a 'safe haven'  for the intellectuals in 1939 - 1944, during both occupations.  Otherwise,  during this period, Lwowian  universities have lost (killed or deported,
mainly to Siberia) over 40% of Professors, with highest loss of  about 90 % at the Medical School  (Albert, 1989a).
<p>&nbsp
<ul>
	<p> <b>(a) The period of Soviet occupation 1939 - 1941:</b>
<p>&nbsp
<p>	During the USSR occupation period of 1939 - 1941, Weigl did  his utmost to  protect  the Institute employees from the systematic and inhumanely cruel deportation to Soviet gulags in the North (for men),  and to Southern Siberia (for women and children, who were arrested at night  and  exiled by trucks  and  trains to very  primitive kolkhoz'es  situated mainly  in the wilderness of Kazachstan),  where the death rate approached 30% per year,  and where I lost many of my friends  and  colleagues (see also,  Kopanski,  1997).   

<p>	About the time when the Soviet secret police (NKVD or  KGB)  organized their first  cruel deportation of  Lvovian population to Siberia,  the first secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party,  Nikita  Khrushchev, has visited  Weigl at his  Institute  and offered him the  title of Academician  and a directorship of an Academy Institute in Moscow.  Weigl has politely rejected it, which fortunately did not  cause  any negative consequences;  instead  Weigl has received  promises of additional buildings  for his Institute in Lwów  (Nespiak  and  Ojrzynski,  1994),  and of an exemption  for his employees  from  deportations  to  Siberia.  

<p>	I  learned about the details of the  Khrushchev's visit from my father,  who spoke fluent Russian (because  long before WW1  he lived and studied in the  Russian-occupied  provinces of Poland, including  Warsaw) .   My father,  Stefan Szybalski,  a pre-WW1  graduate of  the University of Toulouse, France,  was asked  by his friend Prof. Weigl  (who was  unfamiliar with Russian language,  similarly as nearly the entire population  of Lwów, including myself)  to help him in dealings with Russian  visitors and the  Soviet Russian administration, including  Khrushchev and the NKVD (who supervised arrests  and  deportations,   during the 1939-41  period of the Soviet  occupation of Lwów).   It  is  a pity  that Stefan  Szybalski  has not written up his memoirs of this period,   since many famous  Russian  professors and Academicians, who were 'starved'  of the contacts with the Western world made a pilgrimage to  Weigl's Institute  in  Lwów,  considered by Russian  as a Vienna-like Western European  city,  though occupied  then by  Soviets.  Posing as biologist  in  a laboratory  attire,  my father  played  deftly a role of Weigl's  translator.    Frequently, after a few glasses of vodka,  the Russian visitors  could not resist temptation of  describing their  hardships and  then share their personal tales of horror  related to  life in USSR and to Stalin's  terror;    one of  the Russian visitors,  after getting drunk,   gave  the  following very  characteristic  and  helpful advice:  "Do not  ever join the Communist Party  and do not steal excessively".   He then elaborated:  "If you are not a Party member, they will always court you to join,  but once you join and then are kicked out of the Party this is  your end.    If you steal too much this will lead to your demise, but if you do not steal  at all,  you will starve;  thus remember to steal  only in moderation,  just enough to survive !"

	<p>Through his influence, and often helped by my father, Weigl was able to help in securing the release and return to Lwów of several  of the Siberian deportees.  Among those was Stefania Skwarczynska  (at that time at UJK, and after WW2 the Professor of Theory of Literature at University of Lódz, Poland, and a member of PAN),  who was deported to  Kazachstan,  because of her  "guilt"  of  having  a husband, who was a  pre-WW2 colonel of Polish  Army  and at that time a  war prisoner in a German 'Oflag'.   Stefania was helped by her UJK  major professor,  Juliusz  Kleiner,  and  by Weigl to return from Kazachstan in Siberia with her mother and two very young daughters (one of her daughters,  Maria Olszewska, is at present a Professor of Cytology and Cytochemistry of Plants at the University of Lódz, Poland, and a member of PAN).  Weigl has provided  Stefania  with a safe employment in his  Institute, and I trained her to become a louse breeder.  While working with her at adjoining desks in 1941-43,  I learned  plenty about her own and her mother's  and children's hunger and misery of the  inhuman deportation.  She was an enthusiastic and  gifted raconteur,  and as an accomplished story teller, she described to me some amazing and cruel experiences in the steppes of the Soviet Kazachstan,  hundreds of  miles away from the  'civilization' (as represented by the nearest railway station).
	
	<p>My family have also been directly threatened by deportation to Siberia  at least  twice.   Our  Soviet  'passports' were first confiscated  by  NKVD  and then the  dreaded  "paragraph 11"  was added to them;   this  meant that we had to be moved to some place located hundreds of miles away from any even smallest town,  which  'location'  meant   the  wilderness of Siberia.    Again, thanks to  Weigl's  help,  my father  was able to nullify this cruel ruling;  however,  the same happened to us again, but  this time our second "paragraph 11"  ruling  reached us only one day  before the Nazi invasion of  Soviet Union.
	
	<p>Hitler's armies have attacked the  Soviet army  on June 22, 1941,  and entered Lwów on June 29, 1941.   During this ghastly last week of Soviet occupation there were massive arrests  and all jails became overfilled  with Lwowian citizens.   Then in the middle of that week the Soviets have initiated the systematic mass murder  of the prisoners.   
	
	<p>Just after June 30, when Soviet retreated, we have succeeded to enter one of the   prisons,  because I was trying to help my friend in finding his father (who  was  a lawyer and a lice 'feeder'  at the  Weigl's  Institute,  and who was arrested by Soviets a few days earlier).  What we found, were the heeps of the partially decomposing bodies stacked four to ten deep on the cell floors. In this prisons alone, the Soviets have murdered about 3500 prisoners before the Soviet retreat  (Kopanski, 1997). During the next few days of the unusually hot weather, we searched other prisons, finally finding the body of my friend's father among the progressively more viscous mass of the victims of this Soviet atrocity of systematic ethnic murders.  I lost then at least five Lvovian friends or their parents: three Roman catholics, one Greek-catholic and one Jewish.
<p>&nbsp
	
	<p> <b>(b) The period of German occupation (1941 - 1944):</b>
<p>&nbsp
	<p>	During the Nazi occupation of Lwów (1941 - 1944), employment  in Weigl's  Institute provided some degree of protection from the random arrests and deportation to the  Nazi concentration camps; Gestapo seemed to prefer to avoid  'dealings' with persons from whom they might accidentally acquire typhus-infected lice (it was  well  known that carrying  lice was our occupational hazard). Moreover, all employees carried an impressive looking identification card  ("Ausweiss")  from the "Oberkommando des Heeres"  (Office of the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army);  this  "Ausweiss"  was another  of Weigl's   life-saving "inventions" (as  partly  "engineered"  by my father).  The Institut's Headquarter was in Krakow and the German  microbiologist in charge was Dr. H. Eyer, who had a rather fair opinion as not interfering with  Weigl's   pro-Lwowian  activities.  After WWII, Eyer served as Professor at the Max-v.-Petterkofer Institute of Hygiene in Munich.  He described the history of his years with Weigl  (Eyer, 1967).  Another interesting and partially related history of these years is by Lindenmann (2002), a Swiss Professor.
	
	<p>Weigl helped to protect many of the unemployed university professors and their associates by employing them as lice feeders; such employment  entitled  to special food rations  and made them at least partially immune from arrests,  deportations  and/or death during the Nazi occupation.   Some aspects of employment in Weigl's Institute had some elements in common with Spielberg's Hollywood movie "Schindler's List".  I wonder if it is significant that both Weigl and Schindler were born in Moravia and both were recognized byYad Vashem as "Righteous Among the Nations".
	
	<p>Since feeding lice occupied the feeders for only one hour per day, and since the University  (with exception of the Institute of Technology,  renamed by Germans  as "Technische  Fachkurse") was  closed by Nazis, the  'feeders'   had  the remaining time left for organizing the underground University courses and for other educational and patriotic activities.   For instance, I was supervising a  'breeding unit'  consisting of feeders  who were mostly mathematicians of the famous Lwów school of mathematics, including  the world famous professor, Stefan  Banach,  and others including  Jerzy Albrecht,  Felix  Baranski, Bronislaw  Knaster, Wladyslaw Orlicz,   and also other scientists like  Tadeusz  Baranowski (biochemist),  Ludwik  Fleck (bacteriologist; Fleck, 1947),  Seweryn Krzemieniewski  and his wife Helena (both famous bacteriologists),   and Krukowski (archeologist).  Famous artist Stanislaw  Skrowaczewski (with whom I studied piano under Florentyna  Listowska)  was  also  a lice feeder;  he became a composer and a famous conductor of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, whom I was meeting  frequently  at his concerts in  Madison, WI,  in  the  Sixties  or  Seventies.   
	
	<p>Lwów school of mathematics was also known as "Scottish",  not  because of any direct relation  to Scotland,  but because of  the name of the Kawiarnia  Szkocka (Scottish Coffee  House),  where Lwowian mathematician were routinely meeting and solving their  theorems on the paper napkins, on disposable table cloth, or in the famous Scottish Coffee  House Volume.   The first computer language  ("Polish" or  "reverse Polish", as used by  the Hewlett-Packard Company) was  also created by  this group.    It was intellectually very stimulating but also somehow  surrealistic,  to listen to their long discussions about  frontiers of mathematics, including elements of topology and theory of numbers, while they were feeding lice.   However,  I had to watch that  in the fervor of their discussion they did not overfeed lice, beyond 45 minutes, because our laboratory lice lost their natural instinct to stop feeding, with a disastrous consequence to them,  because their guts started to burst due to  'sucking'  too much blood.
	
	<p>During Nazi occupation of Lwów, 1941-44, Weigl used his fame and the pre-WW2 scientific connections with German biologists to protect  all of us from Nazis.  To achieve that, however, he also had  to play dangerous  and  potentially questionable humanitarian role by being forced to produce his vaccine  for  Germans.  At the same time, he had to resist a Nazi's offer to become a director of a special Institute to be established for him in Berlin and to become a German citizen called  "Reichsdeutche".  Despite great personal risks, he made a brave response in 1941/42 to an offer by a high-ranking German Army emissary (as combined with subtle threats);  he said that:  "As  biologist,   I know  the phenomenon of  death;  it is to you  to accept me as  Polish  professor  of  Polish  nationality".    He also added that  "it might appear questionable for the German officer, to offer honors to a Polish Professor, who by accepting the German offer would have dishonored himself".  The high-ranking German officer, apparently a Heinrich Himmler's representative, understood that Professor Weigl was neither to be threatened nor to be bought. Professor Weigl has described this dramatic exchange, thereafter, my   father, Stefan, who in  turn related it to me.  There are also more elaborate versions of this exchange between Weigl and Himmler's representative.
	
	<p>Weigl had  a  permission to have a radio,  and allowed  my father to listen to it  and  spread the political news among  his trusted friends  during this  very  bleak and sad time of the Lwowian  history;  this  access to the radio  was a blessing,  since otherwise there was a death penalty for having a radio.  Weigl was very courageous and not afraid to secretly cooperate with Polish Underground (AK or Polish  Home Army) during Nazi occupation.  Several shipments of Weigl's vaccine were surreptitiously and illegally delivered to the Warsaw ghetto and to other Nazi-established Jewish ghettos in other major cities, where typhus epidemics were rampant.  My father, who was assisting Prof. Weigl in administration of the Exanthematous Typhus and Virus Research Institute,  had  more than once transported the vaccine to the Warsaw ghetto;  I was helping him with that task and delivering the vaccine to Professor Ludwik Hirszfeld, as he describes it in his famous memoirs (Hirszfeld, 1989, pp. 267 and 269).   Tomasz Cieszynski  [whose father, Dr. Antoni Cieszynski, Professor of Stomatology of  UJK, was murdered by Nazi Gestapo in Lwów in  July 1941 (Albert, 1989b) as among the 25 massacred Professors of the UJK,  Politechnika,  and other Academic  Schools of Lwów]  has described  one of the sessions in  Weigl's  office that preceded  the second of the transports of Weigl's  vaccine to the Warsaw ghetto by my father and me (Cieszynski,  1994). The importance of Weigl's vaccine in the Warsaw ghetto was stressed in the famous book by Szpilman (1946; 2002), who says that Weigl was "as famous as Hitler in the Warsaw ghetto", Weigl as a symbol of Goodness and Hitler as symbol of Evil. 
       
	<p>The 'death penalty' threatened all of us engaged in the illegal vaccine transportation, but this did not deter us, since the everyday life was more than dangerous anyway.  As an example of an enormous loss of life in general, of 120 Lvovian chemistry students (about 10 Roman-Catholics,  10  Greek-Catholics  and 100 Mosaic Jewish),  who  together with me succeeded to pass the Communist-administered  entrance examinations as to enroll  in  October/November 1939 at the School of Chemistry  of the Lwów Institute of Technology (Politechnika Lwowska, with its name being modified depending on the changing occupations), only 14 could be accounted for by 1944. 
<p>&nbsp
</ul>

	<p> <b>(3) Re-occupation by Soviet Union in 1944</b>
<p>&nbsp
	<p>	Although successfully resisting the "enticing" German offers in 1942/43, Prof. Weigl was not able to resist the unavoidable forced move in 1944 from Lwów to central Poland.  Soviet army re-entered Lwów in July 1944, and Weigl's beloved city was ethnically cleansed by the Soviet administration, as a consequence of the abominable USA-approved Yalta/Potsdam acts (see Introduction), which authorized the  forced and cruel deportations.   The   annexation of Lwów and its ethnic cleansing were secretly planned in advance and signed by Roosevelt, (later Truman), Churchill and Stalin during the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences.  This was done treacherously, behind the back of the Polish Government in Exile in London, the staunch WW2 ally of USA and UK.   Thus, USA was in fact promoting the second, practically total ethnic cleansing of Eastern Poland by Soviet Union. Such first ethnic cleansing, even a more cruel one, was perpetrated by USSR in the years 1939-41, as a result of the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939, but involved  'only' about 20% of the Lvovian population (and that of the Eastern half of Poland), because USSR did not have enough trains and time to deport to Siberia the entire population (Kopanski, 1997).
	
	<p>Moreover, by this act USA  was also approving all the atrocities inflicted upon Lvovians  during and after  WW2  by the Soviet Union, although USA could have easily prevented this unnecessary tragedy.  A few thousand of survivors and  descendants of the pre-WW2 Lwowians (of Polish citizenship) still remain in Lwów (presently Lviv)  and try to preserve their heritage,  including the Roman-catholic Cathedral,  a  few  churches, and some very monumental and old cemeteries.

<p>Weigl's  scientific  research flourished  in Lwów,  and led to the development of new approaches to study ricketsiology  (and later virology)  and to an effective anti-typhus  vaccine.  This happened in the period between WWI  and  WWII.    Weigl's  Institute remained very active during most of the WWII,  but  Weigl's association with Lwow became terminated  concurrent with the 1944/45  annexation  and ethnic cleansing of Lwów  and Eastern Poland by the Soviet Union.  This annexation in favor of Stalin was very unfair, since  Poland,  after all,  was the first country, which on  September 1, 1939  has resisted Hitler's aggression, whereas Stalin's  USSR  was  Hitler's ally between 1939 and 1941. USSR was actively supporting Hitler's war effort by supplying Germany with train loads of war materials and food.  On the other hand,  a very secret  small unit of the Lwowian underground was charged with disrupting the Soviet supplies for Hitler's armies, which were  attacking Western  Europe;  our unit has derailed or destroyed several Russian-German transport trains in 1940 and up to June 1941 (using explosives, which were secretly produced also by myself  as the student  at  Politechnika Lwowska  in the laboratory of the Organic Chemistry Department  directed by Professor  Edward Sucharda and with his  'blessing').   Derailing  Soviet trains had a doubly beneficial role for the Eastern Poland and Allies, since the same trains  that carried Soviet supplies for Hitler's armies, were used also for  cruel deportation to  Siberia  of  the pre-WW2 Lvovian citizenry and  that of Eastern Poland (Kopanski,  1997).
 	
	<p>During this period of close USSR-Nazi  Germany cooperation, the USSR authorities have also confiscated practically all private property in Eastern Poland, including Lwów.  These properties were never returned to the rightful owners (like,  e.g.,  Professor Weigl,  his family, many University Professors, including those who fed lice,  or  my family and myself), neither at the end of the WW2, nor even now.  Moreover,  the over  600 years of Polish history  of  Lwów  and Eastern Poland,  including many art  galleries,  museums,  historical and scientific edifices,  all that what was the  essence of Polish culture,   had perished  as result of the forced resettlement and ethnic  cleansing.    This is the sad end to the personal fate of Prof. Weigl and many others like him, who gave so much to the science, medicine, and humanity in general,  and as  the 'reward'  were deprived of their roots  and have lost everything, many of them their lives.
	
	<p>One could add here,  at  the end,  that the generally despised insect, louse,  has played a double role during the WW2:  it was not only a carrier of a dreaded disease, typhus,  but ironically it was also protecting lives of those who worked with this insect and of those who were vaccinated with the product of  Weigl's  brilliant research effort.  --- Moreover, one could also conclude that while Weigl was trying to help humanity by developing  his  insect  cultivation  methods  and typhus vaccine, the Stalin's USSR (1939 - 1941 and after 1944)  and Nazi  Germany (1941 -1944)  were engaged in murders and cruel deportations,  whereas the naive and irresponsible   USA  policies of 1943-1950 were  responsible for the further human misery in the USSR-dominated, annexed  or occupied,  but pre-WW2 independent Eastern and Central  European countries,  and moreover, for a definite possibility of a nuclear holocaust,  which almost by miracle  was avoided  because of  Stalin's  death.   Most of that seems to be now forgotten,  and the insect louse  plays practically no role in our lives.   But the noble deeds, courage and  scientific discoveries of Professor Rudolf Weigl and those associated with him should never be forgotten!

<p>Dr. Karl (Karol) Maramorosch, originally from the  Kolomyja  region,  has encouraged and helped me to  prepare this  essay.  The technical part of the  louse breeding and  vaccine  production was based  first on my imperfect memory,    and then  substantially rewritten based  mainly  on the publications of Stefan  Krynski,  Professor  Emeritus of the Medical University of Gdansk (Krynski, 1967a-c,  1997;  Krynski et al., 1994;  and  others  below), who  also read a late version of this manuscript,  all that thanks to the generous help of  Prof.  Janusz Limon, Chairman of the Department of Biology and  Genetics, Medical University of Gdansk.   My  memory was also refreshed  and the manuscript was corrected by my brother,  Stanislaw  Szybalski, as acknowledged inthe text.  Dr. Malina  Kuczynska,  Professor Emeritus of the Slask Institute of Technology in Gliwice,  Poland,  was extremely helpful in locating  persons  connected with the Weigl's Institute,   including  Dr.  Jakub  Cieszynski and his father Dr. Tomasz  Cieszynski;  the latter, a Professor Emeritus of the  Medical Academy in Wroclaw, Poland,  has spent  very many hours correcting  the latest versions of this manuscript and adding some crucial  details (see also Cieszynski, 1994).  Furthermore, I was helped by Profs. Jerzy Wegierski, Katowice (historia konspiracji), Jerzy Chmielowski, Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry of the Slask Institute of Technology in Gliwice,  Poland,  who is trying  to erect  a memorial plaque on the edifice of the former Weigl's Institute  at the corner of Mikolaj  and  Dlugosz  Streets  in Lwów, Poland (presently  Lviv,  Ukraine),   by  Dr.  Liliana  Nitecka,  and by my cousin,  Dr. Romana  Tuma (nee  Bogdanska),  one of the "feeders"  and presently a retired  ophthalmologist in Florida. I am also thankful to mgr. T. Burzynski of the Muzeum Narodowe Ziemi Przemyskiej in Przemysl for many references and drawings. Many others who helped me are mentioned in the text.
  
	<p>The present version contains 15 photos, mainly from the Muzeum Narodowe Ziemi Przemyskiej, which were procured by Stanislaw Kosiedowski, who has kindly affixed those to my manuscript and who is very active in gathering the Weigl's history on his  Internet pages: <a href=http://WWW.LWOW.HOME.PL>http://www.lwow.home.pl</a>.  I am very thankful to him.

Before he had studied in Paris, France, Bonn and Jena, both Germany. In 1866 he completed the 130 pages of his handwritten PhD thesis &quot;<i>Asplenium bulbiferum</i>. A contribution about the development of the fern leave with special attention to the stomata and the chlorophyll&quot;. Finally he accepted an appointment by the University of Bonn, Germany, in 1881 where he worked until his death in 1912 in the marvellous Botanical Institute located at Poppelsdorf Palace.</font></p>
																		<h4><font size="2">Revolution in Cytology</font></h4>
																		<p><font size="2">Strasburger war an excellent teacher and had as many students as <a href="043PfefferCV.html">Wilhelm Pfeffer</a>. However, even after the publication of his often quoted textbook his main interest was in research. He was the first plant scientist who used tissue fixation and staining protocols in microscopy routinely. Therefore he is considered the founder of modern cytology <a href="#Anchor-43728">[2]</a>. </font></p>
																		<h4><font size="2">Dispute during conference</font></h4>
																		<p><font size="2">Because of the unknown staining techniques his results were disqualified as artifacts when he presented them at a botanical conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1877. <a href="#Anchor-24874">Anton de Bary</a> had to take Strasburger's part because of the violent criticism. Using the new methods Strasburger was able to demonstrate that a nucleus of a dauther cell only can derive from the nucleus of the mother cell. He judged this result as that important that he asked his publisher to repurchase the second edition of his book &quot;Generation and Segmentation of Cells&quot; (&quot;Zellbildung und Zelltheilung&quot;) from the marked and to print a corrected third edition. </font></p>
																		<h4><font size="2">60 Years Later his Postulate Was Accepted </font></h4>
																		<p><font size="2">Strasburger mainly worked on fertilization in ferns, conifers and in liverworts. His idea that a female cone is not a flower but an inflorescence was accepted 60 years later through a fossil record found. In 1884 he observed the fusion of nuclei following fertilization which he published in the book &quot;Theory of Generation&quot; (&quot;Theorie der Zeugung&quot;).</font></p>
																		<h4><font size="2">Water transport in dead cells</font></h4>
																		<p><font size="2">However, he was not only interested in cytology but also in physiological processes. In his 1000 pages comprising book &quot;About the Construction and the Performance of Vascular Bundles in Plants&quot; (&quot;Ueber den Bau und die Verrichtung der Leitungsbahnen in den Pflanzen&quot;) he demonstrated that water transport is possilbe without the involvement of living cells.</font></p>
																		<h4><font size="2">Mistakes will disappear in the constant flow</font></h4>
																		<p><font size="2">Taken all together Strasburger had published more than 120 books, reports and reviews comprising more than 6000 pages. He attempted to publish as soon as possible. He achieved this by scribbling his results and thoughts on a dayly basis. Often he maintained this chronological descriptions in his publications. Therefore, books of Strasburger often list countless details and therefore many of them are hard to follow up. This impulsive performance caused some mistakes which, however, didn't bother Strasburger much. His opinion was, &quot;everything in the sciences is in a constant flow&quot;. </font></p>
																		<h4><font size="2">Five honorary doctorates</font></h4>
																		<p><font size="2">The significance of Strasburger's research can be seen in the many terms established by him, like phototaxis, gamete, cyto- and nulceoplasm, pro-, meta- and anaphase, plasmodesms, haploid and diploid. Five universities awarded him an honorary doctor and over 40 national and international academies, societies, and clubs asked him for membership. Moreover Strasburger was one of the founders of the German Botanical Society (Deutsche Botanische Gesellschaft, DBG). </font></p>
																		<h4><font size="2">&quot;Modest and&nbsp;ordinary&quot;</font></h4>
																		<p><font size="2">Despite his achievements he stayed &quot;modest, ordinary, and not overbearing&quot;, as his student and friend G. Karsten wrote.</font></p>

</center>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
This,  T<small>HE</small> H<small>UXLEY</small> F<small>ILE</small>, is addressed to an audience ranging from those who never heard of Thomas Henry Huxley to those who are familiar with him and may even have read some of his work.  For specific guidance on the various subjects he wrote about &#150; fields ranging from the design of marine invertebrate structure to the design of a good human society &#150; the cybernaut may refer to any of the 21 guides concluding this preview. Selections in T<small>HE</small> H<small>UXLEY</small> F<small>ILE</small> that appear only in obscure Victorian magazines or hidden archives will be of interest to those who do know him and may even have studied and published on him.</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
Born on May 4, 1825, and expired on June 29, 1895, THH, it is hoped this project will prove, deserves resurrection into the fame he once enjoyed.  T<small>HE</small> H<small>UXLEY</small> F<small>ILE</small> is a memorial to his achievements in many fields, its ambition to bring forth THH so that we can advance our understanding of Victorian culture, of the contrasting features of superstition and of science, and of our own time; and take pleasure in reading one of the finest writers of any time any where.</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
If THH is known at all, it is as &quot;Darwin&#146;s bulldog.&quot;  This self-imposed nickname recognizes the collegiate defense&#150;and enthusiastic offense&#150;he undertook in support of the theory of evolution.  In November of 1859, after reading the newly-published <I>Origin of Species,</i> he warned Charles Darwin that there would be mischief from anti-evolutionists, and that he himself, T. H. Huxley, was sharpening up his claws preparing to annihilate these creationist critics.  He devoted himself for most of his career defending Darwinism and related notorious subversive subjects</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
"Darwinism" was defined in the Victorian period and is defined today not only as Darwin's theory of natural selection, but as a comprehensive network that includes a philosophical view of the ethical as well as practical significance of scientific investigation; as a type of materialism; as agnosticism; as an assault on the historical validity of scripture; and as a model for the design of a political and economic community.  To all of these, THH contributed, so significantly that though we are not aware of it, much of what educated free people think today of deity, or religion, of science, of their values, and of their own origin and future traces back to Huxley as originator, as he was the inventor of the word "agnostic" itself.</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
Huxley's career testifies to the richness of scientific investigation, the establishment of young rebels as a powerful party, and the pervasive intrusions of secularism during the Victorian period.  He advises us on science as a proper discipline for the school curriculum, on vivisection, on compassion, competition, and capitalism, the U. S. Civil War, nature, chalk, protoplasm, dinosaurs, the pantheon and the pyramids. On the inequality of the races and genders, Thomas Huxley was not so keen or humane a radical as John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor, but did help to diminish stereotypes about skin color and stature being signals of intellectual and emotional value.</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
Huxley's achievements are pertinent today in helping us understand our own culture, for example, on these issues of immediate concern, especially in the U. S.  Here's a list of problems of today that interest or afflict people throughout the world&#150;problems which THH helps us understand and perhaps solve:</P>

<ul>
<li>the role of the government in advancing the academic program of the population, in &#9;supporting museums, in supervising health;
<li>the contest between religious fundamentalism and secularism, e.g., the use of the Bible in &#9;public education, the validity of scripture as a historical,  scientific, and ethical guide;
<li>the assertion of the reality of demons and witches, and of other irrationalities;
<li>the credibility of materialistic language in mapping reality;
<li>the attack on science as being not an analysis of reality but an expression of the &#9;scientist's racial, gender, class and other prejudices;
<li>the movement to abolish the canons and traditions of a liberal education;
<li>the promotion of cultural illiteracy;
<li>the movement to replace a search for facts in historical survey with a search for that &#9;which &#9;will satisfy idiosyncratic, racial, gender, class and other credenda;
<li>the necessity of vivisection;
<li>the trustworthiness of natural selection as an explanation of evolution;
<li>the scenario of evolution, particularly of human evolution;
<li>the inherited or acquired features that distinguish among the races and between the &#9;genders;
<li>the relevance of race as a classifying system for the human species;
<li>the importance of knowing about cultures other than the western;
<li>and the danger to the species of global over-population.
</ul>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
Those merely interested in Huxley and scholars engaged in research on him, on Darwinism, on Victorian culture, on the history of science, and on topics such as those noted will find that T<small>HE</small> H<small>UXLEY</small> F<small>ILE</small>, in which reside over 1000 items, justifies its title.  The 1000 figure covers 680 pieces of published and unpublished <a href=tindex.html>text</a> by THH; more than 150 <a href=iindex.html>pictures</a> by and on him, with an uncounted number of pictures in text by and for him; and 120 <a href=cindex.html>commentaries</a> on him.  Cybernauts will find here</p>

<ul>
<li>the entirety of the nine-volume <I>Collected Essays;</i>
<li>40 selections from the five-volume <I>Scientific Memoirs;</i>
<li>and also a large number of Huxley essays that were never collected, from <I>The Westminster &#9;Review, Youth's Companion,</i>  etc.; among these, the most important hidden pieces are the &#9;three essays he wrote for a club, The Metaphysical Society, on whether a frog has a soul, &#9;whether immortality is reasonable, whether Jesus was actually resurrected;
<li>several pieces that exist only in draft form, such as his teenage journal "Thoughts and &#9;Doings," "Agnosticism&#150;A Fragment" and "The Natural History of Christianity";&#9;
<li>letters published in <I>The Times, Nature,</i> etc.; most of the letters appear in Leonard Huxley, &#9;ed., <I>The Life and Letters of Thomas Huxley</I>  and Julian Huxley, ed., <I>Thomas Henry &#9;Huxley's Diary of the Voyage of H.M.S. Rattlesnake</I> &#150;which is the best provider of THH's diary items; some of the letters come from collections in libraries around the world.
<li>a cornucopia of illustrations ranging from his doodles and sketches of natives to cartoons and portraits of him,  illustrations not attached to any text, and a number illustrating texts such as &#9;<I>Man's Place in Nature </I> and <I>Oceanic Hydrozoa.</I>
<li>120 commentaries on him, some praising his work, others attacking it, such as <I>Powheads, Porwiggles and Protoplasm.</I>
</ul>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
It's perhaps a bit late to say this, but this introduction and all the guides may be skipped, the &#9;cybernaut travelling directly to these selections.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent:28px">
The audience of T<small>HE</small> H<small>UXLEY</small> F<small>ILE</small>, then, is educated people of whatever culture (THH was translated into Chinese and Japanese, as well as into European languages Hungarian, Russian, Italian, German, French, Spanish, and Italian), especially high school and college teachers who can select and present for their students sections from T<small>HE</small> H<small>UXLEY</small> F<small>ILE</small> to enrich, liberalize, and vitalize courses in at least these fields: (1) education, (2) biology,  (3) anthropology, (4) philosophy, (5) religion, (6)  social studies, and (7) style.  Though these categories are designed to help understand Huxley's contributions, it's important to note that he was not a strict disciplinarian&#150;a river of text, essay or letter, could and often did flow with relevant material on all of these and other tributaries  as well.  Huxley's popularization adventures resulted in what he called "fugitive pieces," many of them written when he was assailed by insomnia, and most of them constituting <I>Collected Essays</I> ; but since he was a professional biologist, an ample supply of his <I>Scientific Memoirs</I>  is offered, though most of those pieces would not be understood or appreciated by most of us lay people.</P>
