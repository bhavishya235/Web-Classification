<P>
<font size=+2>T</font>he word "computer" is often 
thought to have been coined with the advent of the first electronic 
computer in 1946. Actually, according to Webster's dictionary, the
earliest recorded use of "computer" came exactly 300 years earlier, in 1646.
<P>
From the 17th century until the turn of the 20th century, the term was 
used to describe people whose jobs involved calculating. In his 
1834 book <I>Memoirs of John Napier of Merchiston</I>, Mark Napier
wrote:"Many a man passes for a great mathematician because he is a huge computer.
Hutton and Maseres were great calculators rather than great mathematicians. 
When their pages were full of figures and symbols, they were happy. [John]
Napier alone, of all philosophers in all ages, made it the grand object of 
his life to obtain the power of calculation without its prolixity."

Human computers have both strengths and weaknesses.  We humans have great powers of reasoning.  Most of the things we do come from knowledge that we have developed
culturally or that we have learned as so-called common-sense rules.  We also have
great tolerance for ambiguity.  Confronted with a sentence that has several possible
interpretations, humans can choose the correct interpretation for the given context. Humans also have the capacity of categorization, such as
identifying and classifying birds, understanding regional variations in accented speech and so on.
<P>
At the same time, we are unable to perform more than one
 calculation at a time (sequential computing).  We compute at a very slow rate, and with a very small memory. Even worse, our
limited memory sometimes causes us to forget intermediate results and thus 
fail to reach solutions. We need to write down many  intermediate results and can use only
simple procedures to solve mathematical problems.
<P>
Since the human computer preceded the electronic computer, and
since humans developed the electronic computer, we created it in
our own image. This means that early electronic reflect our limitations.
Just as the human computer has only one brain, so the early electronic computers
had only one processor. Since our brain can perform only one
calculation at a time, most computers were built to perform only one calculation 
at a time. 
<P>
The world's first large-scale general-purpose electronic computer, 
the  ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer), was designed with 
only one processor. 
<P>
<BR>

  <IMG  SRC=../../../images/research/eniac-electronic-numerical-integrator-and-computer-training-programmers.jpg>

<BR>
<I>Two men (in uniform) being trained to maintain the ENIAC computer. The two women in the photo
were programmers. The ENIAC occupied the entire thirty by fifty feet room.</I>

<BR>
 <P>

One of the primary problems that motivated the design of ENIAC was to calculate
the trajectory of ballistic missiles at the U. S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory in
Aberdeen, Maryland.  Before the invention of  ENIAC, Army engineers used 
176 human computers to perform the calculations needed to produce firing and bombing tables for
gunnery officers.  Such calculations must be sequential,
and therefore they mapped  well onto the early electronic computers and their 
sequential processing.
<P>
Another example of a technology matched to the human image is robotics.  Early robots
tended to have arms and/or legs and one centralized brain.  This design has
shifted recently to one in which robots now have a network of small, 
simple brains (or processors), each devoted to a single job such as lifting an arm.
<P>
     As mathematical reasoning progressed, however, it became apparent that 
sophisticated mathematical techniques suited for electronic computing diverged from those suited
for the human brain.  For example, the 10-based decimal system has proven to be the best for human computers, while the binary system based on the number 2, although too
awkward for humans, is a natural match for electronic computers, where strings of bits with values of either 0 or 1 are used to store data.
<P>
<H4>COMPUTATION-INTENSIVE PROBLEMS</H4>
<P>
"`<I>Firstly, I would like to move this pile from here to there,' he 
explained, pointing to an enormous mound of fine sand,`but I'm afraid that all
I have is this tiny tweezers.' And he gave them to Milo, who immediately 
began transporting one grain at a time</I>." Norton Juster,
<I>The Phantom Tollbooth.</I>
<P>
As mathematics progressed, the tasks  undertaken by human computers grew increasingly complex.
By the late 19th century, certain calculations were recognized as outstripping the
calculating capacity of hundreds of human clerks. 
<P>
The 1880 United States census posed one of the biggest computational challenges of 
that time. To analyze the 1880 census results, the U.S. government employed
an army of clerks (called "computers") for seven years. The population changed
significantly during those seven years, however, rendering the results out of date
before they were published. More timely results could have been 
obtained by employing even more clerks, but that would have been too costly.
<P>
<H4>WORKING IN PARALLEL</H4>
<P>
The human computers worked independently and  simultaneously on the 1880 census data to produce numerous and voluminous sets of tables.  In the field of computation
their method is termed "working in parallel."  It was the best technique known at that time, but since the results were still unacceptably slow in coming, the Census Bureau held
a competition to find a more effective way to count the population.  This competition led to the invention of Hollerith's Tabulating Machine, which was subsequently used
to compute the U.S. population more accurately in 1890.
<P>

  <P>
<H4>A DRAG STRIP FOR COMPUTERS</H4>
<P>
The century-old idea of holding a competition to
solve computation-intensive problems was revived in 1986 by 
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer 
Society with its annual Gordon Bell Prize Competition.
As in 1890, competition has spurred advances in computing.
<P>
The solution of important computation-intensive problems, like those required in weather-prediction, demand the calculation of trillions, quadrillions and even more
calculations, whether by human or mechanical or electronic devices.
Solving these problems one at a time or in a step-by-step fashion is analogous 
to moving a pile of sand one grain of sand at a time.  It takes forever.
<P>
     Fortunately, many computation-intensive problems do not have to be performed one
at a time.  In fact, performing thousands and even millions of calculations at the 
<I>same</I> time is the only way to solve many computation-intensive problems 
quickly enough for the results to do some good. The latter approach is
called massively parallel computing --- but with machines instead of the 
human computers that used this system in the 1880's.
<P>





<H4>NATURAL PARALLELISM</H4>
Researchers are now learning that many problems in nature, 
   human society, science and engineering are naturally parallel, 
that is, that they can be effectively solved by
using mathematical methods that work in parallel.  These problems 
share the common thread of having a large number of
similar "elements" such as animals, people and molecules.
The interactions between the elements are guided by simple rules 
but their overall behavior is complex.
<P>
     An individual ant is weak and slow, but ants have developed a method of foraging for food together with other ants.  Their massively parallel approach is well described
by the scientist and writer Lewis Thomas in <I>The Lives of a Cell</I>:
<P>
    <Blockquote>A solitary ant, afield, cannot be considered to have much of anything on his mind; indeed, with only a few neurons strung together by fibers, he can't be imagined to
have a mind at all, much less a thought.  He is more like a ganglion on legs.  Four ants together, or 10, encircling a dead moth on a path, begin to look more like an idea.
They fumble and shove, gradually moving the food toward the Hill, but as though by blind chance.  It is only when you
watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together
around the Hill, blackening the ground, that you begin to see the whole beast, and now you observe it thinking, planning, calculating.  It is an intelligence, a kind of live
computer, with crawling bits for its wits.
</Blockquote>
<P>
     Massive parallelism can also be found in human society. We see it in wars, elections, economics and other endeavors characterized by the simple, independent and
simultaneous actions of millions of individuals.  This parallelism is so
natural that people aren't even aware of it.  Adam Smith described it in
<I>The Wealth of Nations</I>:
<P>
  <Blockquote>Every individual endeavors to employ his capital so that its
produce may be of greatest value.  He generally neither intends
to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it.
He intends only his own security, only his own gain.  And he is in this
led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his
intention.  By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that
of society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.</Blockquote>
<P>
     In science and engineering the common thread that makes many 
problems naturally parallel is that they are governed by a small 
core of physical laws that are <I>local</I>
and <I>uniform</I>.  Local means that to know the temperature in say, Detroit, in the next few minutes, we only have to know what is happening right now in the nearby
suburbs of Detroit.  Uniform means that the laws governing
weather-formation in Detroit are the same  as in Timbuktu,
Vladivostok  or anywhere else.
<P>
In weather forecasting, five uniform and local laws are used: 
conservation of mass; conservation of momentum;
the conservation equation for moisture; the first law of thermodynamics; and the equation of
state.
<P>
<H4>CHALLENGES IN COMPUTING</H4>
Constructing and running a computer model with the level of spatial
resolution required for accurate computer-based weather forecasting
takes quadrillions of arithmetical operations. Yet even this spatial 
resolution is too coarse to image tornadoes and other damaging local
weather phenomena.
<P>
To improve the spatial resolution so that it images local weather increases 
the amount of calculation required by 10s of times and consequently 
makes the original problem
computationally intractable even for a modern supercomputer.
<P>
The U.S. government has identified weather forecasting
as one of 20  computation-intensive "grand challenges."
Others include improving extraction of oil deposits, modeling
the ocean, increasing computers' skill at understanding human
speech and written language, mapping the human genome, and developing
nuclear fusion. Many other problems in mathematics would take trillions 
of years to solve with the faster 
computers currently available.
<P>
<H4>EXPLOITING PARALLELISM: A PARADIGM SHIFT</H4>
<P>
Seminal ideas in science usually occur in a process that has been described
as a series of paradigm shifts, that is, a shift in the dominant patterns or 
examples which humans use in thinking or portraying "how things are." A well-known example of paradigm shift is the
transition from the belief that the Earth is flat to the belief that it is round. With this paradigm shift, Magellan became aware
that he could travel around the globe.
<P>
If only one human computer had been used to analyze the 1880 census, the work would  have
taken forever to complete. Similarly, if only  one computer were used to solve a 
computation-intensive problem of today, it would take forever to complete it. This paradigm of using one
computer to solve a problem is called <I>sequential computing.</I>
<P>
We are now living through a great paradigm shift in the field of computing, a shift from computing in the image of the 
human brain (sequential computing) to massively parallel computing, which employs
thousands or more computers to solve one computation-intensive problem. Just as a paradigm
shift in the belief about the shape of the Earth led to routine circumnavigations on
the high seas, we would soon routinely solve important societal problems that are
so computation-intensive that we had previously only dreamed of attempting them.  
<P>
Examining the roots of this paradigm shift will show why continuing efforts to solve
computation-intensive problems with sequential computers will succeed only as well as the early aircraft did by attempting to
fly by flapping bird-like wings.
<P>
Since many computation-intensive problems are inherently parallel, it 
only makes sense to build and use a computer that exploits their inherent parallelism. Such a 
computer will give the best performance when it "looks" like the inherently parallel
problems that it is trying to solve. The problems --- such as modeling atmospheric 
conditions, as discussed earlier --- arise from myriad simple interactions between 
thousands or millions of elements. As a result, the total calculations required carry
us into the realm of "teraflops" computing.

<BR>
<I>The cart pulled by the ox represents a conventional supercomputer. Intuition might lead one to think
that the bull can outperform the cart pulled by a multitude of well-trained, harnessed chickens. But the coordination
of many smaller units results in better performance. Similarly, a massively parallel
computer is faster and more powerful than a conventional supercomputer.</I>

<BR><P>
<H4>TERAFLOPS --- HARDLY A DINOSAUR</H4>
<P>
"Teraflops" may sound like the name of a dinosaur, but it does not describe 
extinct creatures, rather a level of computing yet to be achieved --- computing on the 
<I>trillionfold</I> level. The Holy Grail of large-scale computation is to attain 
a sustained teraflops rate in important problems.
<P>
As Elizabeth Corcoran put it in January's <I>Scientific American</I>, "From the 
perspective of supercomputer designers, their decathlon is best described by
 three Ts--a trillion operations a second, a trillion bytes of memory and
data communications rate of a trillion bytes per second."
<P>
<BR>

  <IMG  SRC=abacus.gif>

<BR>
<I>The abacus is the oldest computing machine. It was invented in China about 
2,000 years ago. Two millennia ago, a massively parallel supercomputer
will be 64,000 people operating 64,000 abacuses.

</I>

<BR>
 <P>

<P>
The effort to increase computing speed is an old one. It is the primary 
motivation that led to the invention of the abacus, logarithmic table, 
slide rule and electronic
computer.  However, these devices share one fundamental limitation:  
they are based on sequential computing, and thus are subject to the 
speed limits imposed by computing
singly.  As a result, some investigators now believe that massive parallelism is 
the only feasible approach that can be used to attain a teraflops rate of 
computation.  Only
massive parallelism can allow us to perform millions of calculations at once. 
<P>

  <IMG  SRC=table-of-logarithms-formula.gif>

<BR> 
<I>The general formula for logarithms of numbers. Three hundred and fifty years ago,
 a massively parallel supercomputer
will be 64,000 mathematicians aided by 64,000 tables of logarithms.

</I>

<BR>
 <P>




The most massively parallel computer built so far, known as the Connection Machine, uses 64,000 processors
to perform 64,000 calculations at once. This approach makes it 64,000 times faster than
using one processor.
<P>
The Connection Machine has attained computational speeds in the range of five to 10 billion 
calculations per second. The next generation of the Connection Machine is expected to 
use one million processors to perform one million calculations at once. That could make it one 
million times faster than using a single processor. The target computational speed of this 
machine is one trillion calculations per second.
<P>
<BR>

<BR>
<I>The Pickett linear slide rule. Note that the Pickett manual dated 1960 used the word computer
to denote a person. The manual reads: "A computer who must make difficult
calculations usually has a slide rule close at hand." In the past, a massively parallel supercomputer
will be 64,000 people operating 64,000 slide rules.
</I>

<BR>
 <P>
<P>
Massively parallel computers also have properties that make them far less costly than 
conventional computers. When the number of processors are doubled, the performance doubles, but the
cost increases only by a few percentage points, since many components are shared by all the processors.
<P>
A massively parallel computer also runs cooler than a conventional supercomputer. You can rest 
your hand on it while it runs; it doesn't require the $10,000-a-month energy bills needed to keep a mainframe supercomputer from
overheating.
<P>
We have come a long way from the individual with an abacus to today's massively parallel computers. The motivation
along the path from then to now has been the existence of computation-intensive problems requiring computing
resources of larger magnitude than those available.
<P>
Despite humanity's great progress in computing, the national grand challenges compiled by the U.S. government 
identify computation-intensive problems that will inspire us to find even more 
new ways of computing. In five years, we should be computing  at the teraflops level. It will be fascinating to 
see what achievements  and new challenges will come after that.

<li>The march of technology 
is towards oodles of calculations in almost no time at all.
<li>Simulation of seismic waves propagationg through a model 
containing a salt dome --- an arching formation in sedimentary rock with a mass
of rock salt as its core. Such models require massive amounts of computations at many
sites over regular intervals of time. The demands of a whole class of such computation-intensive problems
is ushering in a new era in computing.

<li>Quadrillions of calculations are needed to model Earth's climate.  
A conventional supercomputer (diagram #1) tries to use one processor to 
perform the quadrillions of
calculations.  It's very powerful, but not powerful or fast enough to 
complete the calculations in time to yield a useful forecast of 
approaching weather.
        
<li>The natural laws governing Earth's weather--and the mathematical equations derived from those laws--operate at all locations in our atmosphere, and in the same way
(diagram #2).  Therefore, the quadrillions of calculations required to solve weather equations are distributed evenly throughout the globe, whether the climatic conditon is a
blizzard in Boise, a thunderstorm in Oslo, torrential rains in Bangladesh or
 bright son over Harare.  When a natural law applies to all locations in the 
same way, the problem is
inherently massively parallel.

<li>The architecture of a massively parallel computer is designed to match 
the computer with the problem.  To perform calculations in weather prediction,
 a massively parallel
computer assigns different locations around the globe to different processors 
inside the computer (diagram #3).  Today, the most powerful massively parallel 
computer has 
64,000 processors. A massively parallel computer with a million processor is under
construction.                               


<li>The 1922 dream of Lewis F. Richardson:  64,000 human computers to calculate the variables required to predict the weather numerically.  He foresaw that 
mathematical forecasting was computation-intensive, but didn't realize it would 
have taken his calculating army 1,000 years to predict the next day's weather!

I WAS very much intrigued by the parallel computation article in the February '91 issue. It seems
to me that this is one of those technological breakthroughs that can have a profound effect in so
many areas of our society that we can make quantum leap forward. Thanks for telling us all about
it. 
<p>
As a former structural engineer and machine designer, I shuddered when I saw your illustration on
the cover of the same publication. While I realize that the picture is illustrative only, may I suggest
that you consult with a good structural engineer before you build that chicken harness. As the
picture stands right now, I would bet on the ox. 
<P>
Keep up the good work.

particularly "One of the World's Fastest Humans" featuring Philip Emeagwali. 
<P>
Being an electrical engineer myself, I found Mr. Emeagwali's work and research captivating and
motivating. I am sure the detailed description given of the parallel supercomputer will be substantial
in the development of my engineering knowledge as well as that of my fellow engineers of the
National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). NSBE is the largest non-profit student-operated
organization in the country dedicated to the academic retention, excellence, graduation and cultural

value of the article for use in secondary and some college classrooms, in a range of disciplines from
mathematics to natural sciences, geography and social science.

Thus, particularly as an Anglo teacher in predominantly non-Anglo classrooms, I have become
personally aware of the needs (including role models) expressed in current studies on the
achievement of students in science and mathematics. Philip Emeagwali's words and example --- as
well as the vitality of his work in computer modeling --- could serve multiple pedagogical purposes
in terms of motivation and consciousness-raising --- notoriously difficult accomplishments in the
area of mathematics. 
<P>
Reading guides and discussion topics with a rich potential for critical reasoning would spring
naturally from these articles. They also constitute excellent materials for learning about mathematics
in expository and narrative, social and historical contexts --- perspectives that are often excluded
from the skill-mastery, problem-oriented environment of school mathematics. 
<P>
I can only state for myself that, if I had a high classroom of my own, I would strive to utilize such
materials of which these present an outstanding example, in order to connect themes, encourage
students and legitimate interdisciplinary learning experiences.

<hr>

MICHIGAN TODAY highlighted parallel processing for computationally intensive computer
problems. The reader was informed of the importance of speed and problem size. The reader was
not cautioned that the results of immense computer problems, done very fast, may still be wrong. 
<P>
The most important problems in physics and engineering are highly nonlinear differential equations.
These state equations are based on a continuous flow model, but computers require these
equations to be modeled as discrete formulations. The latest research shows discrete math models
are subject to "spurious solutions." This means despite extensive parallelism to do huge problem
sizes, the answers are not correct. Chaos in numerical simulations is probably the most important
research issue confronting scientists and mathematicians. Until this problem is recognized and
solved complicated computer simulations, including teraflops, are just very expensive video games.

<B>Philip Emeagwali replies:</B> I agree that chaos can occur in special situations and can cause
spurious (useless) solutions. Interestingly, massively parallel computers are also used to
simulate, study and understand the spurious solutions arising from the phenomenon of chaos. 
<P>
Most important problems are non-chaotic, however, and scientists and engineers use
supercomputers to solve them. For example, the differential equations used by the petroleum
industry are non-chaotic. Although supercomputers are very expensive, an oil company can
discover (or recover) enough oil in just one simulation to pay for the $6 million to $30 million
cost of a supercomputer. This is just one example out of many. Hence, it should not come as a
surprise that the governments of the United States, Japan and several European countries
have all put supercomputing at the top of their list of critical technologies that will help
improve their economic competitiveness. Clearly, governments and industries believe that
supercomputer simulations are not merely expensive video games. 
<P>
I might add that shortly after the first electronic computer was introduced in 1946, one expert
proclaimed: "Surely, the whole world will never need more than 10 of these machines." <BR>

					<p>In this article I take a quick look at the great moments in the history of computers during my lifetime. First written back in 1994 at the dawn of the World Wide Web, this article is updated every few years and over time is building up to become a fascinating look back into computing history. In fact it is already quite interesting, even though I'm still relatively young...</p>

These artifacts, combined with their disks and cartridges, may be disassembled and analyzed, restored and displayed or operated as functioning units--an archaeological, technology challenge that gives students a historical perspective about the computer revolution, both its software and hardware.<p />Traditional antiques are at least 100 years old, but given the rapid, unprecedented changes in microcomputers, game machines, and calculators, any such product that is 10 or more years old might be considered antique.

<p>
Project Delta was an incredible learning experience that introduced thousands of 
Delaware high school students to computing in the 1960's and 70's. Delta was 
founded on the radical idea that computers in education can be run by the 
students. At Delta, the students ran the computer, installed the terminals at 
the schools, improved the operating system, and invented early versions of 
things like e-mail and on-line chat. This web site is dedicated to recording and 
preserving the history of Project&nbsp;Delta.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="normal">Welcome to Calypso's Lecture Series for CS-100.  The first (and only)
lecture in the series is about the history of computing from the
past to the present.  This offers the student or casual browser an
overview of the advances in science that made desktop computers possible
starting with the invention of counting.</p>

<p class="normal">This lecture was originally given in the fall of 1994 at the
University of Regina (Regina, Canada) for 400 CS-100 students.  CS-100 is
an introductory course designed primarily for students from
other disciplines.  It was not intended for the computing
science major student.  As such, this material was
geared to appeal to those students.</p>

<p class="normal">The author would like to thank the copyright holders of the 
various pictures used in this work without formal acknowledgement.  
For copyright information, please contact the author 
Michelle A. Hoyle (thelectureATeingangNOSPAMorg)..
</p>

<p class="normal">Future additions to the lecture include a section discussing
the impact of business microcomputers and mainframes to the
history of computing.</p>


<p class="normal"><b>Teachers</b>, this lecture is available to be used on a standalone 
machine in a classroom.  Drop me some 
mail (thelectureATeingangNOSPAMorg) if you would like a copy for 
use in a classroom, museum, or kiosk. Replace the AT and NOSPAM with an @ and a . respectively</p>

Selecting "Contents" at any point in time will return you to
the table of contents.</p>

<p class="normal">We support some accessibility enhancements.  If your 
browser supports access keys, you may be able to use CTRL+access_key (Macintosh) or 
ALT+access_key (Windows) for navigation.  The access keys were listed above with the 
buttons.  To use them, hold down the ALT key (or the CTRL key on a Macintosh) and then 
press the appropriate access key.  These do not work on all browsers.</p>

<p class="normal">Finally, if you're using a graphical browser, you might
want to consider changing the size of the browser window
to as large as possible.  The slides are quite large.</p>

<P>
The Small-Scale Experimental Machine, known as SSEM, or
<A HREF=mark1/new.baby.html>the "Baby"</A>, was designed and built at
<A HREF="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/">The University of Manchester</A>,
and made its first successful run of a program on <B>June 21st 1948</B>.
It was the first machine that had all the components now classically regarded
as characteristic of the basic computer. Most importantly it was the first
computer that could store not only data but <EM>any (short!) user program</EM>
in electronic memory and process it at electronic speed.
<P>From this Small-Scale Experimental Machine a full-sized 
machine was designed and built, the
<A HREF=mark1/MM1.html>Manchester Mark 1</A>, which by April 1949 was
generally available for computation in scientific research in the University.
With the integration of a high speed magnetic drum by the Autumn (the ancestor
of today's disc) this was the first machine with a fast electronic and magnetic
two-level store. It in turn was the basis of the first commercially available
computer, the
<A HREF=mark1/FM1.html>Ferranti Mark 1</A>, the first machine off the production
line being delivered in February 1951.
<P>
These pages tell the <A HREF=#mark1>story of the Baby and the Mark 1</A>,
and give <A HREF=mark1/celebrations.html>a record of the 50th anniversary
celebrations</A> for the Mark 1, and the machines that followed it.
<P>
The highlight of the 1998 Celebrations was the construction of a
<A HREF=mark1/index.html#baby>working replica of the Baby</A> now on display at the
<A HREF="http://www.msim.org.uk/">Museum of Science
and Industry in Manchester</A>

<EM>Some information on the set of four machines designed by
<A HREF=mark1/kilburn.html>Tom Kilburn</A>'s team following on from the Mark 1
machines, up to 1974, is given in the 
<A HREF=kgill/index.html>Virtual Museum of Manchester Computing</A>. The Mark 1 and the
next three machines were all turned into commercial machines; the fifth, MU5,
made a
<A HREF=mark1/mu5.html>major contribution to the design of the ICL VME2900
series</A>. The

Our timeline includes developments in the 1600's and their impact on computing. The development of the modern day computer was the result of advances in technologies and man's need to quantify. The abacus was one of the first counting machines. (Calculating machines were sold commercially before the advent of steel manufacturing technologies.  Papyrus was something to write on, before we had paper. Writing was a way to record mathematical calculations. )
This history of computers site includes the names of early pioneers of math and computing and links to related sites  for further study.  A new "Timeline of the History of Computers and Related Technologies" has been added.  This site was designed to be used by students assigned topics about the history of computers and computing.

This history of computers site includes the names of early pioneers of math and computing and links to related sites  for further study.  A new "Timeline of the History of Computers and Related Technologies" has been added.  This site was designed to be used by students assigned topics about the history of computers and computing.  Original articles are footnoted and related links are included. 

One important purpose of this Web page, is to debunk myths some people create, such as "we have computers because of the military"  (Not true).  We have computers because man wanted to quantify as early as the ancient Chinese Dynasties, when they created the abacus and used it for calculating, and adding and subtracting in particular... Babbage and Lovelace were "programming" machines as early as the 1800's before any military computer in this country. 1801 was the creation of the Jacquard loom which used "punch cards".  Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs)  have been around since 1885 and the US gov't first used a computer in the 1950's. Great Britain's COLOSSUS was developed before the ENGIGMA, so people trying to perpetuate the importance of the US military in the development of computer technologies is doing a disservice to students. Electronics and related computer development, and the invention of the transistor were all independent of military intent.  If anything, even the totalisator machines were created for statistical purposes and have been used for horse racing, not rocket science.  I love my Mac, and it has no military background that I am aware of.
Military computers did not have integrated circuits like PC computer chips either... Stop saying computer development was military in origin... simply can't back it up with fact.  Yes, the military also had old computers, just like my Commodore was old... but they weren't related... no tubes in my commodore, that was different technology altogether than a military monster computer with vacuum tubes... mechanical relays... ta dah... that was hot stuff in that age.

<B>BABBAGE, CHARLES</B><BR>
<!-- Charles Babbage(1791-1871) -->
Charles Babbage (1791-1871 was born 26 Dec 1791, the son of a London banker.  In his youth he had his own private instructor in algebra and by the time he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, he was advanced in knowledge beyond his tutors in mathematics.
In 1811, he co-founded the Analytical Society to promote continental mathematics and to reform the mathematics of Newton taught at the University at that time. He worked on the calculus of functions in his twenties.  After being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816, Babbage played a role in the development of the Astronomical Society in 1820.  In 1821 he invented the Difference Engine to compile mathematical tables.  The Difference Engine was completed in 1832.  Then he began work on a machine that could do any type of calculation, and this machine was the Analytical Engine completed about 1856.  To learn more about Charles Babbage and his contributions to society, mathetics, engineering, astronomy, and more.... see the following links:<BR>

<A HREF="http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/comphist/">History of Computing Information</A>&nbsp;this Web author would have you believe that computers are here because of the military but the USA wasn't even a thought yet when Babbage and Lovelace were working on and programming machines before the Industrial Revolution, before the production of steel, so the "because of the Army or because of the military is all wet... Eisenhower was President when Russian launched Sputnik and that was a scientific embarassment. In late 1957 (October) Sputnik was launched.  It didn't take long for the President to ask for and for Congress to vote to create ARPA.  (See ARPA links) Later, a branch off of ARPA became NASA and they used computers but projects were space oriented.. ARPANET was the non-military branch that created the Internet nodes, first being at the non-military UCLA.  The ARMY could have computers because of pre-exisiting technologies that had no prior connection with the military. Stop giving the military the credit for having computers... The military had a need and had computers built to fill a need, but none of the technologies up until then had to do with the military's think tank... The inventors were independent of the US military, or had been civililians when asked to help the military to build the computers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<B>OPERATING SYSTEMS</B> are considered part of Software of the computer.. related to Programming.<BR>
The internal Operating System is software programmed to communicate with the hardware of the commputer and determines how the user interacts with the computer; and it regulates input, storage, processing, and output.<BR>
Early computers had very little memory hence, very small operating systems.<BR>

<A HREF="http://inventors.about.com/library/blcoindex.htm">small site, with a smattering of information, condensed timeline of 27 entries from just the 20th century by About.com</A>.  ABOUT.COM'S SURVEY of computer history site, briefly does a fair job of touching the bare surface of the late historical period of the 20th century with some entries in the 21st century but nothing here about 1600's-1899. Not much depth here, but there is a lot of name dropping.  If you need a name, they got 'em. Would be nice to see more Bibliographies, more detail and more depth.  Might be suitable for grade school students. Not enough depth for research.  This is not a significant computer history site, with omissions of important early works, but is owned by a corporation that can afford to do better.<BR>&nbsp;</BR>
<A HREF="http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/">Timeline <B>only from 1939 - 1994</B></A> also omits earlier developments.  This is a good site for information from that narrow time range and it includes personal information about some of the people involved in computer technology in only the 20th century, so far.  Altair, Commodore-64 machines are covered, and other earlier computers such as the machines produced by Konrad Zuse, and his Z4.  Site has a push for monetary donations.  Commercial site.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.computersciencelab.com/ComputerHistory/History.htm">Pictures</A>&nbsp;Site has many pictures, not all from the public domain, but the pictures are not sourced and I )regret that a site supposedly for students has no source information from where they took/acquired the photographic images.  I would like to know if they have permission to use the approx. (stated 50 pictures.?? (Students: you are not to use copyrighted information nor photographs on a Web site without stating the source AND having written permission or you are violating copyright.)

<A HREF="http://www.hitmill.com/computers/computerhx1.html">Hitmill.com's History of Computers</A>&nbsp; has been a leader in the History of Computers parade of sites since 1998, raising the bar and challenging others to get better. A 65-year old grandmother hand-coded this page (and this entire domain, which began in 1998) in NotePad,  to show students that Web pages can be made without buying software.  The site is in the process of adding a timeline and should not be relegated down at the fifth level for it is a quality page with depth, sourcing, footnoting, and Bibliographies in its multiple page structure.  Obviously well planned with the research students in mind. This site has grown up, since 1998, and remains a top "History of Computers and Computing Timeline" Web site.  A historical site made with raw HTML and no software. Non-commercial, non-corporate site, not asking for money, with a couple of click-ads from Google quietly generating pennies for Grandma's hosting.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

Again, we cannot over-emphasize that computers were invented and calculating machines were invented all because of man's need to quantify.  Those wanting to quantify also needed predictability in the World.  Mathematicians used to use a lot of logarithms and had books of algorithms made by a person who did the calculations and such a person was called a "calculator". By the 17th and 18th Centuries we were already migrating gradually into an age where machines would be able to perform the calculations instead of a person.  The ideas were coming from mathematicians faster than the technology of steel production and before steel gear technology... the earliest "machines" were designed for wooden "gears".  Computer input was designed to be done with punch cards which would be "read"  by the machine. The earliest machines could only perform one type of mathematical calculation such as subtraction.  Take a look at this timeline and be surprised with how early we had machines that could perform a calculation.<BR><BR>

<p> At the beginning, I created this database for my private use - to
assist finding whatever I was looking for. However, I have since moved the
database to a public server hoping that it will be useful to someone.

<p> At least search engines seem to like to crawl it.

<p> By no means the content of this database is ment to be complete - there
is only stuff that I have access to; nothing more, nothing less. Further,
it is very likely that there is incorrect content - I'm sure that I have at
least mixed up some of the authors. When you happen to spot an error, then
please <a href="mailto:rtiainen@devili.iki.fi">let me know</a>.

<p>Some statistics: The database contains 372 books, 565 issues of 55 magazines and 65 software titles.

History of Hard Drives</H3>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
The hard disk drive was invented by some IBM engineers working under Rey Johnson at IBM in San Jose, CA,
in about 1952 to 1954. I worked at IBM from 1965 to 1981 and got to meet and work with some of those men
- Rey Johnson, John Lynott, Don Cronquist, Bob Schneider and Lou Stevens come to mind right now.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
In 1965 (I think that was the year) a number of engineers left IBM (they were known as the &quot;dirty
dozen&quot; within IBM) and founded Memorex. Al Shugart, one of them, later left Memorex and founded first
Shugart Associates where the 5 1/4&quot; floppy disk drive was a major product, then Seagate Technology,
which effectively started today's industry of small hard disk drives.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
The early drives almost all had linear actuators, that is, they moved the heads across the disks in a
straight line, using a carriage with wheels. It was only later that rotary actuators, where the heads
are held at the tips of a comb-like array and they swing back and forth like a gate, became popular. Because
the rotary actuator is cheaper, it's now the standard for all hard disk drives, and that's what I'll be
talking about.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
The first IBM RAMAC disk drive had a couple of dozen disks, each about 2 feet in diameter, and ONE head!
The head was moved from disk to disk and back and forth on each disk using a system of cables and pulleys
and stepping motors. The added speed of having at least one head for each disk surface, and of using both
surfaces of each disk, soon became obvious, and drives began to look pretty &quot;modern&quot; by 1960,
although they were vastly larger and more expensive. Whether the heads are moved in a straight line or
swung in an arc, something has to provide the force and the control to move them and keep them in the
right place.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
Stepping motors, hydraulic actuators and voice coil motors have been used to provide the motive force.
Stepping motors have a built-in capability to hold in one position. Hydraulic actuators and voice coil
motors (VCMs) provide force, but can't hold a position with great accuracy. A rack with detent pawls has
been used, but nowadays a servo system is used, with the positioning information recorded on the disks.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
So you can have a disk drive with a stepping motor and you don't need a &quot;servo&quot; or you can have
a disk drive with &quot;servo data&quot; recorded on the disks. A stepping motor is simpler (at least
in concept) and cheaper, but it's slower in seek time because it isn't really very powerful, and it isn't
capable of really, really fine precision. A VCM can provide enormous forces, but it needs control, which
the servo system provides. However servo feedback systems are complicated and you have to pre-record the
positioning data somehow (usually on one or more of the disks), and that takes up space that could be
used for &quot;real&quot; data. On the other hand, servo systems can provide incredibly precise positioning.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
The style of hard disk drive we use today began to emerge in the early 1980s. I think it was Maxtor, under
Frank Gibeau, where the first high-volume 5 1/4&quot; disk drives with a rotary actuator, a VCM and a
servo system were produced.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
In 1986, Finis Conner left Seagate and founded Conner Peripherals along with John Squires, and they built
the first high-volume 3 1/2&quot; disk drives. The first one, 40 MB, was called the &quot;Fat 40&quot;.
Not only did they popularize the new smaller &quot;form factor&quot;, but they were the first to have
an &quot;embedded servo&quot; or &quot;sector servo&quot; in volume.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
Meanwhile, Quantum Corporation had been building 8&quot; and 5 1/4&quot; disk drives since 1980, and in
the mid 1980's they (actually I think it was Joel Harrison and Bill Moon) saw an opportunity with the
3 1/2&quot; form factor and invented the &quot;hard card&quot;, a disk drive on an expansion card that
you could just plug into your AT. And that's how the IDE interface got started.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
By the way, Quantum used a rather odd variant of the servo system for many years, where the servo information
was actually very fine lines etched on a piece of glass attached to the actuator, and read with a photocell.
It's actually more complicated, but that's a subject for another discussion.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
Around 1990, laptops began to appear, and with them came the 2 1/2&quot; form factor. I never worked closely
with 2 1/2&quot; drives, and I'm not very well versed in their historical development.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
Way back in the old days, when the world was young and all, &lt;g&gt;, a single disk surface was reserved
for &quot;servo data&quot; on disk drives that had a voice-coil actuator. Drives with stepper motors didn't
need that stuff, and could justly claim that they didn't have to &quot;waste&quot; disk surface on &quot;servo
data&quot;.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
Servo data, by the way, is information that's pre-recorded on the disk and specially formatted to make
it possible for the drive to know where its heads are positioned. A stepper motor has, if no errors have
occurred, the equivalent information built into its mechanical structure.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
But during the late 1970s and early 1980s, techniques were developed that allowed the servo data to be
written on the same surfaces that hold the regular user data. There were several schemes proposed and
actually implemented, but the one that has taken hold is called &quot;sector servo&quot;, where some number
of regions on each data track are specially reserved for servo information. Because the sectors are physically
coherent on each disk surface, they're commonly called &quot;servo spokes&quot;. I've seen drives with
as few as 64 spokes per revolution and as many as 128.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
I believe the first major manufacturer to use sector servo was Conner--sector servo and the 3 1/2&quot;
form factor were their keys to success when they started in (I think) 1986. [At the time, I was one of
the majority of old disk drive people who thought they were headed for disaster. Later, I worked there.
Shows how smart I am!]</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
While there may still be drives manufactured with a dedicated servo surface, I think the last major manufacturer
to use one was Seagate, up until a couple of years ago. The first Barracuda drive had a dedicated servo
surface. Later Barracudas, and I think all current Seagates, use sector servo technology.</P>
<P CLASS="NormalText">
Disk drive production has become easier nowadays - there are even <!--ForeHelp.Hotspot JUMP=""--><!--ForeHelp.EndHotspot--><A HREF="http://www.primelec.com/Hard-Drives-Storage/c116834/" TARGET="_blank">cheap
hard drive deals</A> which indicate cost-efficient manufacturing of these devices.</P>

<H1>Computer History, the Automatic Totalisator</H1>
<P>This is an introductory page to several, non-commercial pages on antiquated totes. Although these pages specifically relate to the invention of the world's first automatic totalisator in 1913 and its subsequent development, they are an example of "mechanical computing".
There are many analogies which make these early totalisators appeal to computer history enthusiasts.
The metrics used such as sales per minute and number of terminals. These systems also had distributed points of sale and a central processing facility connected in a fashion that is reminiscent of data networks. There were input devices, the ticket issuing machines and output devices, total counters and odds indicators. An electro mechanical device called a scanner seems to me to be the mechanical counterpart of a serial line multiplexer. There was a mechanical device for adjusting the amount of commission deducted from the pool. Additionally there is information on some old electronic totalisator systems. It would appear that this belongs in the realm of computer history!
<P>Dive straight in by going to the <A HREF="index.html#index">index </A>or starting from the <A HREF="index.html#top">beginning</A> </P>
<P>The largest of these mechanical / electro mechanical installations that I am aware of was in Longchamps France in 1928 with 273 terminals. Have a look at the <A HREF="tote.htm#timelines">chronology </A>of the early installations. </P>
<P>To read about the way these mechanical and electro mechanical systems differed from adding machines of the time see extracts of a <A HREF="calcaids.htm#top">paper </A>presented by George Julius to the Institution of Engineers Australia in 1920. These were multi user systems. </P>
<P>An electro mechanical system was built and tested in Sydney Australia capable of 250,000 sales per minute from 900 terminals. George Julius <A HREF="calcaids.htm#speed">referred </A>to this system in his address to the Institution of Engineers Australia. </P>
<P>See a newspaper reporter's <A HREF="american.htm#top">description </A>of an electro mechanical totalisator installation in Miami in 1932. </P>
<P>The company that manufactured these mechanical and electro mechanical systems also developed the world's first <A HREF="american.htm#aqueduct">electronic totalisator </A>system, which was installed in New York. </P>
<P>There is also some information on other electronic totalisator installations. The <A HREF="tote.htm#brisbane">Brisbane system </A>was a duplex Digital Equipment Corporation PDP11  based totalisator installed in Brisbane Australia in 1978. </P>

Welcome to Computer Chronicles: From Stone to Silicon!  This page is designed to inform people young and old about how the 
computers that we use today came into being.  The voyage starts in about 3000 BC, with the invention of the abacus in 
ancient China.  It proceeds through the development of vacuum tubes, transistors, integrated circuits, microprocessors and 
countless other inventions until the computer of today.  <br><br>

I've re-organised the timelines, by splitting everything into a series of
smaller timelines.  There's still a bit of work to do in sorting out
exactly what should be in each timeline and I've got quite a lot of
updating that I want to do.  Hopefully it's now much easier to find
things, and people on slower connections can avoid downloading the entire
timeline!  The entire timeline is still available for those who want it.

<H3>Hardware History Overview</H3>

Modern computing can probably be traced back to the 'Harvard Mk I' and
Colossus (both of 1943). Colossus was an electronic computer built in
Britain at the end 1943 and designed to crack the German coding system -
Lorenz cipher. The 'Harvard Mk I' was a more general purpose
electro-mechanical programmable computer built at Harvard University with
backing from IBM. These computers were among the first of the 'first
generation' computers.

<p>

First generation computers were normally based around wired circuits
containing vacuum valves and used punched cards as the main (non-volatile)
storage medium. Another general purpose computer of this era was 'ENIAC'
(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) which was completed in
1946. It was typical of first generation computers, it weighed 30 tonnes
contained 18,000 electronic valves and consumed around 25KW of electrical
power. It was, however, capable of an amazing 100,000 calculations a
second.

<p>

The next major step in the history of computing was the invention of the
transistor in 1947. This replaced the inefficient valves with a much
smaller and more reliable component. Transistorised computers are normally
referred to as 'Second Generation' and dominated the late 1950s and early
1960s. Despite using transistors and printed circuits these computers were
still bulky and strictly the domain of Universities and governments.

<p>

The explosion in the use of computers began with 'Third Generation'
computers. These relied Jack St. Claire Kilby's invention - the integrated
circuit or microchip; the first integrated circuit was produced in
September 1958 but computers using them didn't begin to appear until 1963.
While large 'mainframes' such as the I.B.M. 360 increased storage and
processing capabilities further, the integrated circuit allowed the
development of Minicomputers that began to bring computing into many
smaller businesses.

Large scale integration of circuits led to the development of very small
processing units, an early example of this is the processor used for
analyising flight data in the US Navy's F14A `TomCat' fighter jet.  This
processor was developed by Steve Geller, Ray Holt and a team from
AiResearch and American Microsystems.

<p>

On November 15th, 1971, Intel released the
world's first commercial microprocessor, the 4004.  Fourth generation
computers were developed, using a microprocessor to locate much of the
computer's processing abilities on a single (small) chip.  Coupled with one of
Intel's inventions - the RAM chip (Kilobits of memory on a single chip) -
the microprocessor allowed fourth generation computers to be even smaller
and faster than ever before. The 4004 was only capable of 60,000
instructions per second, but later processors (such as the 8086 that all
of Intel's processors for the IBM PC and compatibles is based) brought
ever increasing speed and power to the computers. Supercomputers of the
era were immensely powerful, like the Cray-1 which could calculate 150
million floating point operations per second. The microprocessor allowed
the development of microcomputers, personal computers that were small and
cheap enough to be available to ordinary people. The first such personal
computer was the MITS Altair 8800, released at the end of 1974, but it was
followed by computers such as the Apple I &amp; II, Commodore PET and
eventually the original IBM PC in 1981.

<p>

Although processing power and storage capacities have increased beyond all
recognition since the 1970s the underlying technology of LSI (large scale
integration) or VLSI (very large scale integration) microchips has
remained basically the same, so it is widely regarded that most of today's
computers still belong to the fourth generation.  <!-- As to whether the
5th generation will be based on parallel computing or on optical chips, or
some other new technology - we'll just have to wait and see what has the
greatest impact.  Such decisions can only be made with hindesight, when
you can look back and identify the key turning points. -->

<A NAME="internet"></A>

<H3>History of the Internet</H3>

The internet's history can be traced back to ARPANET - which was started
by the US Dept. of Defense for research into networking sometime in 1969.
<p>
Many people wanted to put their ideas into the standards for
communication between the computers that made up this network, so a system
was devised for putting forward ideas.  Basically you wrote your ideas in
a paper called a 'Request for Comments' (RFC for short), and let everyone
else read it.  People commented on and improved your ideas in new RFCs.  
The first RFC (RFC0001) was written on April 7th, 1969.  There are
now well over 2000 RFCs, describing every aspect of how the internet
functions.
<p>
The first Interface Message Processor (IMP) was plugged in and switched on in
Len Kleinrock's lab at UCLA on 2nd September 1969, forming the beginning of an real network to test the ideas.
<p>
ARPAnet was opened to non-military users later in the
1970s, and early takers were the big universities - although at this stage
it resembled nothing like the internet we know today.  International
connections (i.e. outside America) started in 1972, but the internet was
still just a way for computers to talk to each other and for research into
networking, there was no World-Wide-Web and no email as we now know it.
<p>
It wasn't until the early to mid 1980s that the services we now use most
on the internet started appearing.  The concept of 'domain names', things
like 'microsoft.com', and special `Domain Name Servers' wasn't even
introduced until 1984 - before that all the computers were just addressed
by their IP addresses (numbers).  Most protocols used for email and other
services appeared after this - although email itself had been around much
longer the way it was sent between institutions was less standardized.
<p>
The part of the internet most people are
probably most familiar with is the World-Wide-Web.  This is a collection
of hyperlinked pages of information distributed over the internet via a
network protocol called HTTP (hyper-text-transfer-protocol).  This was
invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.  He was a physicist working at CERN,
the European Particle Physics Laboratory, and wanted a way for physicists
to share information about their research - the World-Wide-Web was his
solution.  So the web was started, although at this time it was text-only.  
Graphics came later with a browser called NCSA Mosaic.  Both Microsoft's
Internet Explorer and Netscape were originally based on NCSA Mosaic.
<p>
The graphical interface opened up the internet to novice users and in 1993
its use exploded as people were allowed to 'dial-in' to the internet
using their computer at home and a modem to ring up an 'Internet Service
Provider' (ISP) to get their connection to this (now huge) network.  
Before this the only computers connected were at Universities and other
large organisations that could afford to hire cables between each other to
transfer the data over - but now anyone could use the internet and it
evolved into the 'Information Superhighway' that we know and (possibly)
love today. 
<p> 

<!-- Currently hosts on the internet are identified by a 32 bit number, their
'IP Address'.  This limits the number of directly connected computers to a
theoretical maximum of 2^<sup>32</sup> - or slightly over 4 billion.  In
practise to make routing simpler (the process where information packets
find the computer they are intended for) this set of numbers is split into
'netblocks' which wastes some of them.  In order to increase the number to
accomodate further expansion it is intended eventually to move to
addresses consisting of 128 bits, but at present only a handfull of
computers are setup to understand such addresses and it is only really
used for research and development. -->

<H3>History of Windowing Systems</H3>

The first concept of a windowing (or WIMP - windows, icons, menus and pointers)
system appeared inside the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973.  The
'Alto' computer was only availably internally, it wasn't until 1981 that Xerox
released the refined version to the world: the 8010 ('Star') system.  This idea
was then used by Apple, first for the Applie 'LISA', and then again in 1984 as
they developed the MacOS operating system for use on their Apple Macintosh.
Microsoft followed on, releasing the first version of 'Windows' in 1985.
Windows was a GUI (graphic user interface) for their own operating system
(MS-DOS) that had been shipped with IBM PC and compatible computers since 1981.
Windows was designed to look a bit like MacOS but unfortunately it was so
similar that Apple decided to take Microsoft to court over it .. a court case
that was to run for many years.
<p>
This first version of Windows wasn't very powerful and so not very
popular.  Popularity increased with the release of Windows 2 in 1987.  The
first really popular version of Microsoft Windows was version 3.0, released in
1990.  This benefited from the improved graphics available on PCs by this time,
and also from the 80386 processor which allowed 'true' multitasking of the
Windows applications.  This made it more efficient and more reliable when
running more than one piece of software at a time.  It would even allow you to
run and multitask older MS-DOS based software.  Windows 3 made the IBM PC a
serious piece of competition for the Apple Mac.  Various improvements - Windows
3.1 and Windows 3.11 were released, although to the user they looked very similar to Windows 3.
<p>
Also available at a similar time to Windows 3 was IBM's OS/2 (which was
actually written in partnership with Microsoft).  This was followed by OS/2
Warp, which was a full 32 bit operating system designed exclusively for the
80386 and better processors.  It came out long before Windows 95, and boasted
many similar features.  Unfortunately IBM failed to market it successfully
enough and it didn't catch on.
<p>
Windows 95 was released in 1995 (no surprises there), in August. 
Although it shared much code with Windows 3 and even MS-DOS, Windows 95
had two big advantages.  First, it was an entire Operating System, you
no-longer needed to buy MS-DOS and then install Windows on top of it. 
Second it was specially written for 80386 and better processors and made
'full' use of the 32 bit facilities.  In this respect Windows 95 moved
closer to Windows NT.
<p>
Windows NT (New Technology) was developed alongside Windows for use on servers
and businesses. It is designed to be more reliable and secure than Windows
95, but as a trade-off it is less compatible with older MS-DOS based
software (crucially for the home market it won't run many video games).
<p>
1998 (June 25) saw the release of Windows 98, which is very similar to
Windows 95, except that it provided an improved filing system (which controls the way data is stored on disks), the improvements allowed it to support disks larger than the 2 GB allowed by the first release of Windows 95.  Windows 98 also brought support for USB and AGP.
<p>
It was Microsoft's aim - with Windows 2000 - to merge the two seperate versions
of Windows (Windows 95/8 and Windows NT) into one product.  This failed.  Windows 2000 was based on Windows NT, internally it often refers to itself as 'NT 5', but it boasts a slightly prettier interface and a more exciting name than previous members of the NT series.  Because of the memory protection (which helps provide reliability and security for the NT series), Windows 2000 is unable to run some of the 'legacy software' (in particular games) that Windows 95 and 98 can.  This resulted in the development of Windows Millenium Edition (ME), a new member the 95/98 family.
<p>
The next major release of Microsoft Windows was 'Windows XP', again the intention of Microsoft was that this release would replace both the older versions of Windows: NT/2000 and the 95/8/ME family.  Again Windows XP is a really a continuation of the Windows NT product line, but this time Microsoft were successful in selling it to the home users that traditionally bought 95, 98 or ME.  This success was partially because of improved technology, but largely because a long time (6 years or more) had passed since the first release of Windows 95 (which marked the end of MS-DOS development).  This meant that much of the 'legacy' MS-DOS/non-Windows software (and in particular games) that caused problems under Windows 2000 had been re-written or replaced to work properly under Windows, so was no longer such an issue for Windows XP.
<p>
All this leaves the question of the court case between Apple and Microsoft, the
one Apple started in 1985 by trying to sue Microsoft for copying the 'look and
feel' of their operating system.  Well the answer was that in 1997, August 6,
after 18 months of losses by Apple, Microsoft helped 'bail' them out of serious
financial trouble by buying 100,000 non-voting shares in the company for $150
million.  Microsoft had several political reasons for doing this, but one
condition was that Apple had to drop this long-running court case.
<p>
It is also worth mentioning another windowing system, the 'X Window System'.
This was developed at MIT, starting in 1984, for use on graphics workstations.
Due largely to the availability of the source code used to write it, it has
become the standard graphical interface on many Unix based systems - including
most Linux distributions.  Although the X Window System provides functionality
for drawing and moving Windows on the screen and also for providing a mouse
cursor it provides none of the user interface features (such as buttons, menus,
window title bars and so on) that people expect.  These features are provided
by other pieces of software, window managers, graphics toolkits, and the like.
The most popular graphical desktop environments under Linux rely on the X
Window System but also provide all of the other features themselves - so providing an integrated and uniform interface to the user.  Most popular of these
are KDE and GNOME.  Solaris users have CDE, which provides similar
functionality for their workstations.

<h3 class="section"><a name="Beginning"></a>In The Beginning&#8230;</h3>
<p>The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, at the birth of the <a href="http://www.ee.ryerson.ca:8080/~elf/abacus/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','']);">abacus</a>, a wooden rack holding two horizontal wires with beads strung on them. When these beads are moved around, according to<strong><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/language-research.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.cs.cmu.edu']);"> programming</a></strong> rules memorized by the user, all regular arithmetic problems can be done. Another important invention around the same time was the <a href="http://www.saundersandcooke.com/cath.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.saundersandcooke.com']);">Astrolabe, used for navigation.</a> <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Pascal.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Blaise Pascal</a> is usually credited for building the first <strong>digital</strong> computer in 1642. It added numbers entered with dials and was made to help his father, a tax collector. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Leibniz.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Leibniz invented a computer that was built in 1694. It could add, and, after changing some things around, multiply. </a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Leibniz.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Leibniz invented a special <strong>stepped gear mechanism</strong> for introducing the addend digits, and this is still being used.</a> <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Leibniz.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">The prototypes made by </a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Pascal.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Pascal and </a><a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Leibniz.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Leibniz</a> were not used in many places, and considered weird until a little more than a century later, when Thomas of Colmar (A.K.A. Charles Xavier Thomas) created the first successful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmometer" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">mechanical calculator</a> that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. A lot of improved desktop calculators by many inventors followed, so that by about 1890, the range of improvements included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accumulation of partial results</li>
<li>Storage and automatic reentry of past results (A memory function)</li>
<li>Printing of the results</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these required manual installation. These improvements were mainly made for commercial users, and not for the needs of science.</p>

<h3 class="section"><a name="babbage"></a><strong>Babbage</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignleft c1" style="margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/img/comp/babbage.jpg" alt="Image" width="180" height="180"/>While Thomas of Colmar was developing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmometer" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">desktop calculator</a>, a series of very interesting developments in computers was started in Cambridge, England, by Charles <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a> (<em>left</em>, of which the computer store &#8220;<a href="http://www.gamestop.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.gamestop.com']);">Babbages</a>, now GameStop, is named), a mathematics professor. In 1812, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a> realized that many long calculations, especially those needed to make mathematical tables, were really a series of predictable actions that were constantly repeated. From this he suspected that it should be possible to do these automatically. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine, which he called a <strong><a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/computing_and_data_processing/1862-89.aspx" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk']);">difference engine</a></strong>. By 1822, he had a working model to demonstrate with. With financial help from the British government, <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a> started fabrication of a difference engine in 1823. It was intended to be steam powered and fully automatic, including the printing of the resulting tables, and commanded by a fixed instruction program. The difference engine, although having limited adaptability and applicability, was really a great advance. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a> continued to work on it for the next 10 years, but in 1833 he lost interest because he thought he had a <strong>better idea</strong> &#8212; the construction of what would now be called a general purpose, fully program-controlled, automatic mechanical digital computer. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a> called this idea an <strong>Analytical Engine</strong>. The ideas of this design showed a lot of foresight, although this couldn&#8217;t be appreciated until a full century later. The plans for this engine required an identical decimal computer operating on numbers of 50 decimal digits (or words) and having a storage capacity (memory) of 1,000 such digits. The built-in operations were supposed to include everything that a modern general &#8211; purpose computer would need, even the all important <strong>Conditional Control Transfer Capability</strong> that would allow commands to be executed in any order, not just the order in which they were programmed. The analytical engine was soon to use <strong><a href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.cs.uiowa.edu']);">punched cards</a></strong> (similar to those used in a Jacquard loom), which would be read into the machine from several different <strong>Reading Stations</strong>. The machine was supposed to operate automatically, by steam power, and require only one person there. <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a>&#8216;s computers were never finished. Various reasons are used for his failure. Most used is the lack of precision machining techniques at the time. Another speculation is that <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a> was working on a solution of a problem that few people in 1840 really needed to solve. After <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Mathematicians/Babbage.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk']);">Babbage</a>, there was a temporary loss of interest in automatic digital computers. Between 1850 and 1900 great advances were made in mathematical physics, and it came to be known that <em>most observable dynamic phenomena can be identified by </em><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">differential equations</a></em>(which meant that most events occurring in nature can be measured or described in one equation or another), so that easy means for their calculation would be helpful. Moreover, from a practical view, the availability of steam power caused manufacturing (boilers), transportation (steam engines and boats), and commerce to prosper and led to a period of a lot of engineering achievements. The designing of railroads, and the making of steamships, textile mills, and bridges required <strong><a href="http://www.calculus.net/ci2/search/?request=category&amp;code=12&amp;off=0&amp;tag=9200438920658" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.calculus.net']);">differential calculus</a></strong> to determine such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.calculus.net/ci2/search/?request=category&amp;code=12&amp;off=0&amp;tag=9200438920658" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.calculus.net']);">center of gravity</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.calculus.net/ci2/search/?request=category&amp;code=12&amp;off=0&amp;tag=9200438920658" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.calculus.net']);">center of buoyancy</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Even the assessment of the power output of a steam engine needed mathematical integration. A strong need thus developed for a machine that could rapidly perform many repetitive calculations.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="Hollerith"></a>Use of Punched Cards by Hollerith</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft c1" style="margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/img/comp/hollerith.jpg" alt="Image" width="112" height="190"/> A step towards automated computing was the development of punched cards, which were first successfully used with computers in 1890 by <a href="http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/hollerith/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.history.rochester.edu']);">Herman Hollerith</a> (<em>left</em>) and James Powers, who worked for the <a href="http://www.census.gov/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.census.gov']);">US. Census Bureau</a>. They developed devices that could read the information that had been punched into the cards automatically, without human help. Because of this, reading errors were reduced dramatically, work flow increased, and, most importantly, stacks of punched cards could be used as easily accessible memory of almost unlimited size. Furthermore, different problems could be stored on different stacks of cards and accessed when needed. These advantages were seen by commercial companies and soon led to the development of improved punch-card using computers created by <a href="http://www.ibm.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ibm.com']);">International Business Machines (IBM), </a><a href="http://www.spectrumbrands.com/corpinfo/history.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.spectrumbrands.com']);">Remington</a> (yes, the same people that make shavers), Burroughs, and other corporations. These computers used electromechanical devices in which electrical power provided mechanical motion &#8212; like turning the wheels of an adding machine. Such systems included features to:</p>
<ul>
<li>feed in a specified number of cards automatically</li>
<li>add, multiply, and sort</li>
<li>feed out cards with punched results</li>
</ul>
<p>As compared to today&#8217;s machines, these computers were slow, usually processing 50 &#8211; 220 cards per minute, each card holding about 80 decimal numbers (characters). At the time, however, punched cards were a huge step forward. They provided a means of I/O, and memory storage on a huge scale. For more than 50 years after their first use, punched card machines did most of the world&#8217;s first business computing, and a considerable amount of the computing work in science.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="EDC"></a>Electronic Digital Computers</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft c1" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/img/comp/mauchly.jpg" alt="Image" width="150" height="232"/>The start of World War II produced a large need for computer capacity, especially for the military. New weapons were made for which <strong>trajectory tables</strong> and other essential data were needed. In 1942, John P. Eckert, <a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/mauchly/jwmintro.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.library.upenn.edu']);">John W. Mauchly (left)</a>, and their associates at the <a href="http://www.ee.upenn.edu/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ee.upenn.edu']);">Moore school of Electrical Engineering of University of Pennsylvania</a> decided to build a high &#8211; speed electronic computer to do the job. This machine became known as <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a> (Electrical Numerical Integrator And Calculator) The size of <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a>&#8216;s numerical &#8220;word&#8221; was 10 decimal digits, and it could multiply two of these numbers at a rate of 300 per second, by finding the value of each product from a multiplication table stored in its memory. <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a> was therefore about 1,000 times faster then the previous generation of relay computers. <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a> used 18,000 vacuum tubes, about 1,800 square feet of floor space, and consumed about 180,000 watts of electrical power. It had punched card I/O, 1 multiplier, 1 divider/square rooter, and 20 adders using decimal ring <strong>counters</strong>, which served as adders and also as quick-access (.0002 seconds) read-write register storage. The executable instructions making up a program were embodied in the separate &#8220;units&#8221; of <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a>, which were plugged together to form a &#8220;route&#8221; for the flow of information. <img class="alignleft c2" style="margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/img/comp/edvac.jpg" alt="Image"/>These connections had to be redone after each computation, together with presetting function tables and switches. This &#8220;wire your own&#8221; technique was inconvenient (for obvious reasons), and with only some latitude could <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a> be considered programmable.

<h3 class="section">The Modern Stored Program EDC</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft c1" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 5px; float: left;" src="/img/comp/neumann.jpg" alt="Image" width="200" height="161"/> Fascinated by the success of <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a>, the mathematician <a href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/VonNeumann.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://ei.cs.vt.edu']);">John Von Neumann</a> (<em>left</em>) undertook, in 1945, an abstract study of computation that showed that a computer should have a <strong>very simple, fixed physical structure</strong>, and yet be able to execute any kind of computation by means of a <strong>proper programmed control</strong> without the need for any change in the unit itself. <a href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/VonNeumann.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://ei.cs.vt.edu']);">Von Neumann</a> contributed a new awareness of how practical, yet fast computers should be organized and built. These ideas, usually referred to as the stored &#8211; program technique, became essential for future generations of high &#8211; speed digital computers and were universally adopted.</p>
<p>The Stored &#8211; Program technique involves many features of computer design and function besides the one that it is named after. In combination, these features make very &#8211; high &#8211; speed operation attainable. A glimpse may be provided by considering what 1,000 operations per second means. If each instruction in a job program were used once in consecutive order, no human programmer could generate enough instruction to keep the computer busy. Arrangements must be made, therefore, for parts of the job program (called subroutines) to be used repeatedly in a manner that depends on the way the computation goes. Also, it would clearly be helpful if instructions could be changed if needed during a computation to make them behave differently.</p>
<p><a href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/VonNeumann.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://ei.cs.vt.edu']);">Von Neumann</a> met these two needs by making a special type of machine instruction, called a <strong>Conditional control transfer</strong> &#8211; which allowed the program sequence to be stopped and started again at any point &#8211; and by storing all instruction programs together with data in the same memory unit, so that, when needed, instructions could be arithmetically changed in the same way as data. As a result of these techniques, computing and programming became much faster, more flexible, and more efficient with work. Regularly used subroutines did not have to be reprogrammed for each new program, but could be kept in &#8220;libraries&#8221; and read into memory only when needed. Thus, much of a given program could be assembled from the subroutine library.</p>
<p>The all &#8211; purpose computer memory became the assembly place in which all parts of a long computation were kept, worked on piece by piece, and put together to form the final results. The computer control survived only as an &#8220;errand runner&#8221; for the overall process. As soon as the advantage of these techniques became clear, they became a standard practice.</p>

<p>The first generation of modern programmed electronic computers to take advantage of these improvements were built in 1947. This group included computers using Random &#8211; Access &#8211; Memory (RAM), which is a memory designed to give almost constant access to any particular piece of information. . These machines had punched &#8211; card or punched tape I/O devices and RAM&#8217;s of 1,000 &#8211; word capacity and access times of .5 Greek MU seconds (.5*10-6 seconds). Some of them could perform multiplications in 2 to 4 MU seconds.</p>
<p>Physically, they were much smaller than <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a>. Some were about the size of a grand piano and used <strong>only 2,500</strong> electron tubes, a lot less then required by the earlier <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.seas.upenn.edu']);">ENIAC</a>. The first &#8211; generation stored &#8211; program computers needed a lot of maintenance, reached probably about 70 to 80% reliability of operation (ROO) and were used for 8 to 12 years. They were usually programmed in ML, although by the mid 1950&#8242;s progress had been made in several aspects of advanced programming. This group of computers included <a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/mauchly/jwm9.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.library.upenn.edu']);">EDVAC</a> (above) and <a href="http://www.gvu.gatech.edu/gvu/people/randy.carpenter/folklore/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.gvu.gatech.edu']);">UNIVAC</a> (right) the first commercially available computers.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="50Advance"></a>Advances in the 1950&#8242;s</h3>
<p>Early in the 50&#8242;s two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the electronic &#8211; computer field, from one of fast but unreliable hardware to an image of relatively high reliability and even more capability. These discoveries were the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_memory" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">magnetic core memory</a></strong> and the <strong>Transistor &#8211; Circuit Element</strong>. These technical discoveries quickly found their way into new models of digital computers. RAM capacities increased from 8,000 to 64,000 words in commercially available machines by the 1960&#8242;s, with access times of 2 to 3 MS (Milliseconds). These machines were very expensive to purchase or even to rent and were particularly expensive to operate because of the cost of expanding programming. Such computers were mostly found in large computer centers operated by industry, government, and private laboratories &#8211; staffed with many programmers and support personnel.</p>
<p>This situation led to modes of operation enabling the sharing of the high potential available. One such mode is batch processing, in which problems are prepared and then held ready for computation on a relatively cheap storage medium. Magnetic drums, magnetic &#8211; disk packs, or magnetic tapes were usually used. When the computer finishes with a problem, it &#8220;dumps&#8221; the whole problem (program and results) on one of these peripheral storage units and starts on a new problem. Another mode for fast, powerful machines is called time-sharing. In time-sharing, the computer processes many jobs in such rapid succession that each job runs as if the other jobs did not exist, thus keeping each &#8220;customer&#8221; satisfied. Such operating modes need elaborate <strong>executable</strong> programs to attend to the administration of the various tasks.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="60Advance"></a>Advances in the 1960&#8242;s</h3>
<p>In the 1960&#8242;s, efforts to design and develop the fastest possible computer with the greatest capacity reached a turning point with the LARC machine, built for the <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.llnl.gov']);">Livermore Radiation Laboratories</a> of the University of California by the Sperry &#8211; Rand Corporation, and the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/story/era2.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ibm.com']);">Stretch computer by IBM</a>. The LARC had a base memory of 98,000 words and multiplied in 10 Greek MU seconds. Stretch was made with several degrees of memory having slower access for the ranks of greater capacity, the fastest access time being less then 1 Greek MU Second and the total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words. During this period, the major computer manufacturers began to offer a range of capabilities and prices, as well as accessories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consoles</li>
<li>Card Feeders</li>
<li>Page Printers</li>
<li>Cathode &#8211; ray &#8211; tube displays</li>
<li>Graphing devices</li>
</ul>
<p>These were widely used in businesses for such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Payroll</li>
<li>Inventory control</li>
<li>Ordering Supplies</li>
<li>Billing</li>
</ul>
<p>CPU&#8217;s for these uses did not have to be very fast arithmetically and were usually used to access large amounts of records on file, keeping these up to date. By far, the most number of computer systems were sold for the more simple uses, such as hospitals (keeping track of patient records, medications, and treatments given). They were also used in libraries, such as the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.nlm.nih.gov']);">National Medical Library</a> retrieval system, and in the <a href="http://www.cas.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.cas.org']);">Chemical Abstracts System</a>, where computer records on file now cover nearly all known chemical compounds.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="Recent"></a>More Recent Advances</h3>
<p>The trend during the 1970&#8242;s was, to some extent, moving away from very powerful, single &#8211; purpose computers and toward a larger range of applications for cheaper computer systems. Most <strong>continuous-process manufacturing</strong>, such as <a href="http://www.npradc.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.npradc.org']);">petroleum refining and electrical-power distribution systems, now used computers of smaller capability for controlling and regulating their jobs.</a></p>
<p>In the 1960&#8242;s, the problems in programming applications were an obstacle to the independence of medium sized on-site computers, but gains in applications programming language technologies removed these obstacles. Applications languages were now available for controlling a great range of manufacturing processes, for using machine tools with computers, and for many other things. Moreover, a new revolution in computer hardware was under way, involving shrinking of computer-logic circuitry and of components by what are called <strong>large-scale integration</strong> (<a href="http://www.lsilogic.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.lsilogic.com']);">LSI</a> techniques.</p>
<p>In the 1950s it was realized that &#8220;scaling down&#8221; the size of electronic digital computer circuits and parts would increase speed and efficiency and by that, improve performance, if they could only find a way to do this. About 1960 <strong>photo printing</strong> of conductive circuit boards to eliminate wiring became more developed. Then it became possible to build resistors and capacitors into the circuitry by the same process. In the 1970&#8242;s, <strong>vacuum deposition of transistors</strong> became the norm, and entire assemblies, with adders, shifting registers, and counters, became available on tiny &#8220;chips.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1980&#8242;s, <strong>very large scale integration</strong> <a href="http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/vlsi/vlsi.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu']);">(VLSI)</a>, in which hundreds of thousands of transistors were placed on a single chip, became more and more common. Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced in the 1970s programmable <strong>minicomputers</strong> supplied with software packages. The &#8220;shrinking&#8221; trend continued with the introduction of personal computers (PC&#8217;s), which are programmable machines small enough and inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by individuals. Many companies, such as <a href="http://www.apple-history.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.apple-history.com']);">Apple Computer</a> and <a href="http://www.radioshackcorporation.com/company/history.php" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.radioshackcorporation.com']);">Radio Shack</a>, introduced very successful PC&#8217;s in the 1970s, encouraged in part by a fad in computer (video) games. In the 1980s some friction occurred in the crowded PC field, with Apple and IBM keeping strong. In the manufacturing of semiconductor chips, the <a href="http://www.intel.com/museum/archives/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.intel.com']);">Intel</a> and <a href="http://www.motorola.com/General/Timeline/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.motorola.com']);">Motorola Corporations</a> were very competitive into the 1980s, although Japanese firms were making strong economic advances, especially in the area of memory chips.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, some personal computers were run by microprocessors that, handling 32 bits of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second. Microprocessors equipped with read-only memory (ROM), which stores constantly used, unchanging programs, now performed an increased number of process-control, testing, monitoring, and diagnosing functions, like automobile ignition systems, automobile-engine diagnosis, and production-line inspection duties. <a href="http://www.cray.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.cray.com']);">Cray</a> Research and Control Data Inc. dominated the field of supercomputers, or the most powerful computer systems, through the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, however, the Japanese government announced a gigantic plan to design and build a new generation of supercomputers. This new generation, the so-called &#8220;fifth&#8221; generation, is using new technologies in very large integration, along with new programming languages, and will be capable of amazing feats in the area of artificial intelligence, such as voice recognition.</p>
<p>Progress in the area of software has not matched the great advances in hardware. Software has become the major cost of many systems because programming productivity has not increased very quickly. New programming techniques, such as object-oriented programming, have been developed to help relieve this problem. Despite difficulties with software, however, the <strong>cost per calculation</strong> of computers is rapidly lessening, and their convenience and efficiency are expected to increase in the early future. The computer field continues to experience huge growth. Computer networking, computer mail, and electronic publishing are just a few of the applications that have grown in recent years. Advances in technologies continue to produce cheaper and more powerful computers offering the promise that in the near future, computers or terminals will reside in most, if not all homes, offices, and schools.</p>
