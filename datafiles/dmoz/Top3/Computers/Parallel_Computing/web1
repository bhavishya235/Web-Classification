    In his 1917 work, "On Growth and Form,"
      D'Arcy Thompson altered mathematical functions in order to visualize
      how species changed shape over time. <br><br>
      NASA scientists are using Thompson's biomathematical studies
      of life forms on Earth to postulate about life forms throughout
      the universe. There are certain universal conditions that will
      always affect the shape of a life form, wherever that life may
      be.<br><img width="166" align="LEFT" src="/media/medialibrary/1999/05/28/ast28may99_1_resources/karnerbluesmFW.jpg" border="0" height="128"><br>
      "Everywhere Nature works true to scale, and everything has
      a proper size accordingly," wrote Thomspon. "Cell and
      tissue, shell and bone, leaf and flower are so many portions
      of matter, and it is in obedience to the laws of physics that
      their particles have been moved, moulded and conformed."<br><br>

      Gravity, for instance, acts on all particles and affects matter
      cohesion, chemical affinity and body volume. Other influences
      that are consistent throughout the universe are temperature,
      pressure, electrical charge and chemistry.<img width="188" align="RIGHT" src="/media/medialibrary/1999/05/28/ast28may99_1_resources/Thompson_D'Arcy2.jpg" border="0" height="217"><br><br>
      Right: Professor D'Arcy Thompson
      (1860-1948) of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.<p></p><p>But before we can conduct a comprehensive search for unknown
      extraterrestrial forms of life, there needs to be an extensive
      classification of known life forms on Earth. The history of life
      on Earth provides us with a good model for how life can evolve
      in the universe. Fossils, even microbial fossils, can tell us
      a great deal about all the different life forms that have at
      one time or another shown their face on our planet.<br><br>
      "Some fossils in the ancient Burgess shale are so alien
      we can't determine which end of the creatures are up, and yet
      these monsters evolved right here on Earth from the same origins
      that we did," wrote Johan Forsberg, a Swedish psychologist.</p><p>By becoming forensic scientists, researchers at the Space
      Sciences Laboratory at the Marshall Space Flight Center can develop
      an encyclopedia of microbial life forms that have developed on
      Earth. Because so many life forms need to be catalogued, the
      scientists are working to develop a "D'Arcy Machine"
      to help them create a comprehensive "Book of Life."
    </p><p>This Book of Life project has three phases. Phase 1 - compiling
      a beginning database of microbial life forms - has already been
      completed. This image database is composed of 10,000 examples
      and distinguishes the basic microbial shapes such as rods, spheres,
      filaments, clusters that look like grapes (<img width="200" align="LEFT" src="/media/medialibrary/1999/05/28/ast28may99_1_resources/bacteria.gif" border="0" height="133">cocci),
      and spirochete (spirals). A computer neural network has been
      trained to recognize and classify these microbial life forms
      with 90 percent accuracy.<br><br>

      life. Photo Credit: University of Miami Department of Biology.</p><p>Phase 2 of the project will expand the basic database by using
      a more powerful neural network. Funds from the NASA Advanced
      Concepts Office provided Marshall scientists with a Beowulf-class
      parallel computer. NASA developed the Beowulf Project to address
      scientific problems associated with large data sets. <br><br>
      Left: The logo for the Beowulf Project

      A Beowulf-class computer is a cluster of personal computers running
      LINUX, connected by its own private LAN (Local Area Network).
<br><br>
      Scientists at Marshall have named the new parallel computer "Leibniz,"
      after the German mathematician whose lifelong goal was to organize
      all human knowledge. This computer system will expand the image
      database by acquiring and classifying new and ambiguous images.
      To discriminate organic life forms from inorganic shapes, microbiologists
      often use the vague criteria, "Does it look alive to you?"
      A parallel computer using pattern recognition can make this task
      easier and more exact by breaking the starting image down into
      identifiable parts.</p><p>"Human judgement is still very much depended upon for
      identifying microbial life forms," says Dr. David Noever
      of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. "Automated filters
      would be much like the filters commonly used to sort out useful
      e-mails from useless ones. The user of the neural network would
      get a morning menu of microbial candidates for further detective
      work."<br><br>
      Although the trained human eye is better at recognizing microbial
      life forms, using a computer "filter" to check for
      life-like patterns could help cut the immense scale of the Book
      of Life project down to a more manageable size. <br><br></p><table cellpadding="0" width="575" border="0" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td width="100%">Â Left:
            How the computer neural network sees microbial life forms. From
            left to right: rods, cocci, filaments. An 8x8 pixel microbial
            image represents a 64-dimension classification problem, with
            a pixel array where each binary [0<img width="300" align="LEFT" src="/media/medialibrary/1999/05/28/ast28may99_1_resources/mix2.gif" border="0" height="180"> or 1] value requires a connection in
            the neural network. Although the microbial images must be simplified
            in the same way that computer scanners reduce alphabetic letters
            to a skeleton representation, the basic templates for classifying
            microbial shapes can still discriminate enough to give identifications.
            These images were included in the paper, "Microbial Morphometry:
            Automated AI Approaches," presented at the 50th anniversary
            D'Arcy Thompson conference by Dr. David Noever of NASA/Marshall.</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>
      By Phase 3 of the project, the neural network will be so advanced
      in its learning that it will be able to acquire and classify
      new images with minimal human supervision. This network would
      then be equipped for future search scenarios, including the examination
      of meteorites found on Earth and samples retrieved from lunar
      or interplanetary space missions. This advanced neural network
      will be a fast and efficient classifier of the vast amount of
      microbial images that will need to catalogued.
    
  

    
      <p><b>A Big Problem</b><br>
      This speed and efficiency are extremely important due to the
      detail with which the samples must be analyzed. Not only are
      there a lot of samples to study, but there are multiple dimensions
      to consider. D'Arcy Thompson used mostly linear and quadratic
      maps to compare different life forms. Linear maps between two
      shapes require four coefficient variables, while quadratic maps
      use 10 variables.<br><br>
      Thompson wrote in "On Growth and Form," "I know
      that in the study of material things number, order, and position
      are the threefold clue to exact knowledge: and that these three,
      in the mathematician's hands, furnish the first outlines for
      a sketch of the Universe."<br><img width="300" align="LEFT" src="/media/medialibrary/1999/05/28/ast28may99_1_resources/darcy5.gif" border="0" height="218"><br>
      Left: Thompson's sketches of human,
      chimpanzee and baboon skulls overlaid with mathematical grids.</p><p>While Thompson and other biomathematicians used almost exclusively
      linear and quadratic distortions to study how life forms change
      over time, it is unlikely that complex life forms throughout
      the universe will be confined to these narrow statistical relationships.
      In a paper presented last September at the 50th anniversary D'Arcy
      Thompson conference in Dundee, Scotland, Noever asked, "What
      if D'Arcy had had a computer?"</p><p>When D'Arcy Thompson introduced the idea of studying organisms
      by their geometric shapes, he could only draw figures by hand.
      The computers of today can take Thompson's research much further.
      By repeatedly comparing and contrasting learnable imagery, a
      D'Arcy machine would expand the chapters of the Book of Life
      Project and give us an interplanetary version of D'Arcy Thompson's
      classic "On Growth and Form."<img width="114" align="RIGHT" src="/media/medialibrary/1999/05/28/ast28may99_1_resources/Astronaut.jpg" border="0" height="300"></p><p>Computers with artificial intelligence using neural networks
      provide more opportunities to answer complex astrobiology imaging
      questions. The non-linear evolution of artificial intelligence
      is customized to handle the learning of multiple patterns or
      images. Computers with artificial intelligence could accommodate
      various influencing variables (such as gravity) that change over
      scales much larger than a linear variance can include. Changes
      in the effects of gravity on a body can occur, for instance,
      when humans go into outer space. Astronauts often experience
      fluid retention, excessive bone loss and muscle wasting due to
      the effects of microgravity.<br><br>
      Right: Mission Specialist Richard
      Linneham works out to combat the effects of microgravity onboard
      Space Shuttle Columbia.</p><p>The neural network at Marshall will be able to rapidly process
      the complex computations necessary for mathematically analyzing
      the shapes of life (morphometrics). If someone continuously used
      a hand calculator to tabulate just linear connections, at a rate
      of one calculation per second it would take forty years to finish
      a billion calculations. The Linux-based computer at Marshall
      speeds up this process dramatically, processing over a billion
      connections per second.

      The powerful capabilities of a D'Arcy classification machine
      could also be used to study and catalogue images from the 14
      known Martian meteorites. The total mass to be scanned exceeds
      20 kilograms (44 lbs.), so if micron scale images are included
      in future projects (1 micron is 1-millionth of a meter, or 1/25,000
      of an inch) the combined image handling capabilities for biogenic
      classification will exceed several trillion frames.

      <p>"Looking for life forms in Mars rocks means analyzing
      microfossils - like potential nanometer-size - so small that
      50,000 could fit across the width of a single strand of human
      hair," says Noever.</p><p>Based on past performance, the Antarctic meteorite (ANSMET)
      field teams are likely<img width="300" align="RIGHT" src="/media/medialibrary/1999/05/28/ast28may99_1_resources/MarsHubble.jpg" border="0" height="294"> to
      recover at least 1,000 meteorites over the next three years.
      Although it is likely that only a small fraction of these meteorites
      will be of interest scientifically, already AMNSET has discovered
      28 meteorites that are often sampled for study. Since 1976, 301
      individual investigators representing 24 nations have received
      more than 10,800 meteorite samples. <br><br>
      Right: The Allan Hills meteorite
      (ALH 84001) discovered by ANSMET is believed to be of Martian
      origin. A possible microfossil found in a sample of the meteorite
      measures less than 1/100th the width of a human hair.<br><br>
      To put this scale of computer acquisition and search in context,
      compare it to the challenge of creating the 1996 animated feature
      "Toy Story." It took nearly 3 hours for a supercomputer
      to process each one of that film's 140,000 frames. The challenge
      of classifying images of life forms constitutes a task exceeding
      the creation of more than 10,000 high quality computer-animated
      films.

      finding life forms on Earth that we never before thought possible.
      Extremeophiles (bacteria that live in extreme environments) have
      recently been found living in hydrothermal vents and in high
      salt environments - areas once thought to be completely inhospitable
      to life. In 1997, Stephen Zinder of Cornell University discovered
      the existence of bacteria that thrive in the harsh solvents perchloroethylene
      and trichloroethylene that are used to clean machine parts. An
      acid-loving bacteria, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, can live under
      conditions that would dissolve human skin in seconds.

      methods of communication, avoidance of death...<img width="94" align="RIGHT" src="/media/medialibrary/2006/10/02/ast05aug99_1_resources/bee2.gif" border="0" height="94"><br><br>
      Nervous systems: diffuse (invertebrates), central nerve ring
      (starfish), dorsal nerve cord (vertebrates)...<br><br>
      Sensitivity to light (sight): infrared (snakes), ultraviolet
      (moths, bees), polarized light (octopus)...<br><br>
      Sensory perception for motion, temperature, position, gases (such
      as oxygen or carbon dioxide), certain chemicals, vibrations and
      electricity vary widely among organisms. Some sense perceptions
      seem to operate in a collective or cooperative manner, as in
      the case of army ants, termites, or bees, where group intelligence
      is greater than the knowledge of the single organism.

<p>The Grid Computing
Information Centre (GRID Infoware: <A href="http://www.gridcomputing.com">http://www.gridcomputing.com</A>) aims to promote the development
and advancement of technologies that provide seamless and scalable access
to wide-area distributed resources. <A href="http://www.gridbus.org/~raj/papers/gridtech.pdf">Computational Grids</A> enable the sharing, selection, and aggregation of a wide variety of geographically
distributed computational resources (such as supercomputers, <A href="http://www.buyya.com/cluster">compute clusters</A>, <A href="http://www.buyya.com/superstorage/">storage systems</A>, data sources, instruments, people) and presents them as a single, unified
resource for solving large-scale compute and data intensive computing applications (e.g,
<A href="http://buyya.com/papers/vlab-drug-design.pdf">molecular modelling for drug design</A>, <A href="http://buyya.com/papers/neurogrid-ccpe.pdf">brain activity analysis</A>, and <A href="http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/">high energy physics</A>).

This idea is <A href="http://www.gridbus.org/papers/WeavingGrid.pdf">analogous to electric power network (grid)</A> where power generators are distributed, but the users are able to access electric power without bothering about the source of energy and its location.

PARALLEL COMPUTING DEAD?<br>									<b> Ken Kennedy, Director, CRPC </b></h4>							</div>							<hr>									The announcement that Thinking Machines would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcyprotection, although not  unexpected, sent shock waves through the high-performance computing community. Coupled with the well-publicizedproblems of Kendall Square Research and the rumored  problems of IntelSupercomputer Systems Division, this event has led many people toquestion the long- term viability of the parallel computing industry andeven parallel computing itself. Meanwhile, the dramatic strides in theperformance of scientific workstations  continues to squeeze the marketfor parallel supercomputing. On several recent occasions, I have beenasked whether parallel computing will soon be relegated to the trashheap  reserved for promising technologies that never quite make it.Washington certainly seems to be looking in  the other direction--agencyprogram managers, if they talk of high-performance computing at all,seem to  view it as a small and relatively unimportant subcomponent ofthe National Information Infrastructure. 							<p>Is parallel computing really dead? At the very least, it is undergoing amajor transition. With the end of the  cold war, there is less fundingfor defense-oriented supercomputing, which has been the traditionalmainstay  of the high-end market. If parallel computing is to survive inthe new environment, a much larger fraction  of sales must be toindustry, which seems to be substantially less concerned with high-endperformance.  Two factors bear on the size of the industrial market forparallel computing. First, most engineering firms  have recently madethe transition away from mainframes to workstations. These companiesbelieve that if they need more computational power than they have on asingle workstation, they should be  able to get it by using a network ofsuch machines. Whether or not this is true, it has substantiallyaffected  sales of tightly coupled parallel systems and must be takeninto account when analyzing the needs of  industry users. 							<p>A second factor affecting commercial sales of parallel computer systemshas been the reluctance of independent software vendors like MacNeal-Schwendler to move their applications to parallel machines. I believethe primary reason for this reluctance has been the absence of anindustry standard interface that supports machine-independent parallelprogramming. Without such a  standard, a software vendor's investment inconversion to parallel machines is not protected--when a new  parallelcomputing architecture with a new programming interface emerges, theapplication would need to  be retargeted. 							<p>So is parallel computing on its last legs? Although good news has beenvery limited over the past few  months, there are several reasons why itis too soon to give up: 							<ul>								<li> First, no matter how powerful the workstation processor is, if itis possible to  write programs that scale from one processor tothousands, there will be plenty of  applications that can take advantageof the additional computational power due to  parallelism. Even high-endworkstation companies acknowledge this by providing multiprocessors andsupport for clusters. 								<li> Second, the software and algorithms problems that must be solvedfor scalable  parallel systems to be usable (e.g., development ofscalable parallel programming  interfaces and standard programminglanguages) also need to be solved for networks of workstations if  theyare to succeed as high-end computing engines. 								<li> Finally, I believe independent software vendors will adoptparallelism when parallel programming  interfaces become industrystandards. Recently, J.S. Nolan and  Associates, a vendor of reservoiranalysis codes, has undertaken a major project  to implement their verypopular code VIP in PVM. This has been made possible by the portabilityof  PVM, which has yielded implementations on most common  parallelcomputing systems, including networks of workstations. 							</ul>									From the outset, we have known that a lot of work was needed to makescalable parallel computing truly useful. Projects at the Center forResearch on Parallel Computation and  throughout the computationalscience community are now beginning to bear fruit. Standards like HighPerformance Fortran and Message Passing Interface, along with portablesystems like PVM, are beginning to make parallel computing morepalatable to commercial firms. 							<p>So I assert that parallel computing is not dead--it is simply sufferingthrough a period of growing pains. We are coming to realize thatparallel computing is really a software problem. Therefore, we shouldnot be too distressed when a company drops out of the crowded hardwaremarket. The industry needs software and standards to make writingparallel applications easier. If it gets them, the whole industry willgrow, creating more business for  everyone. 							<HR>							<A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents<csobj occur="99" w="490" h="45" t="Component" csref="../../../CRPCWeb.data/Components/oct94_newsletter_footer.html">									<div align="center">										<hr>										<p><a href="index.html#news">News</a> | <a href="index.html#director">From the Director</a> | <a href="index.html#profile">Parallel Profile</a> | <a href="index.html#res_focus">Research Focus</a> | <a href="index.html#work">Work in Progress</a> | <a href="index.html#educ">Education / Outreach</a> | <a href="index.html#res">Resources</a> | <a href="cal.html">Calendar</a> | <a href="../../index.html">CRPC Home</a></p>									</div>								</csobj></A><!-- #EndEditable --></td>				</tr>			</table>			<p></p>		</body>	<!-- #EndTemplate --></html>++++++++++++++++++++<Over>++++++++++++++++++++

                <p> AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -- <CITE>The Matrix</CITE> may be the future of virtual reality, but researchers say the Grid is the future of collaborative problem-solving. </p> <p> More than 400 scientists gathered at the Global Grid Forum this week to discuss what may be the Internet's next evolutionary step. </p> <p> Though distributed computing evokes associations with populist initiatives like SETI@home, where individuals donate their spare computing power to worthy projects, the Grid will link PCs to each other and the scientific community like never before. </p> <p> <droplink /> </p> <p> The Grid will not only enable sharing of documents and MP3 files, but also connect PCs with sensors, telescopes and tidal-wave simulators. </p> <p> IBM's Brian Carpenter suggested "computing will become a utility just like any other utility." </p> <p> Carpenter said, "The Grid will open up ... storage and transaction power in the same way that the Web opened up content." And just as the Internet connects various public and private networks, Cisco Systems' Bob Aiken said, "you're going to have multiple grids, multiple sets of middleware that people are going to choose from to satisfy their applications." </p> <p> As conference moderator Walter Hoogland suggested, "The World Wide Web gave us a taste, but the Grid gives a vision of an ICT (Information and Communication Technology)-enabled world." </p> <p> Though the task of standardizing everything from system templates to the definitions of various resources is a mammoth one, the GGF can look to the early days of the Web for guidance. The Grid that organizers are building is a new kind of Internet, only this time with the creators having a better knowledge of where the bottlenecks and teething problems will be. </p> <p> The general consensus at the event was that although technical issues abound, the thorniest issues will involve social and political dimensions, for example how to facilitate sharing between strangers where there is no history of trust. </p> <p> Amsterdam seemed a logical choice for the first Global Grid Forum because not only is it the world's most densely cabled city, it was also home to the Internet Engineering Task Force's first international gathering in 1993. The IETF has served as a model for many of the GGF's activities: protocols, policy issues, and exchanging experiences. </p> <p> The Grid Forum, a U.S.-based organization combined with eGrid - the European Grid Forum, and Asian counterparts to create the Global Grid Forum (GGF) in November, 2000. </p> <p> The <A HREF="http://www.gridforum.org/">Global Grid Forum</A> organizers said grid communities in the United States and Europe will now run in synch. </p> <p> The Grid evolved from the early desire to connect supercomputers into "metacomputers" that could be remotely controlled. The word "grid" was borrowed from the electricity grid, to imply that any compatible device could be plugged in anywhere on the Grid and be guaranteed a certain level of resources, regardless of where those resources might come from. </p> <p> Scientific communities at the conference discussed what the compatibility standards should be, and how extensive the protocols need to be. </p> <p> As the number of connected devices runs from the thousands into the millions, the policy issues become exponentially more complex. So far, only draft consensus has been reached on most topics, but participants say these are the early days. </p> <p> As with the Web, the initial impetus for a grid came from the scientific community, specifically high-energy physics, which needed extra resources to manage and analyze the huge amounts of data being collected. </p> <p> The most nettlesome issues for industry are security and accounting. But unlike the Web, which had security measures tacked on as an afterthought, the Grid is being designed from the ground up as a secure system. </p> <p> <!-- pagebreak --> <BR>Conference participants debated what types of services (known in distributed computing circles as resource units) provided through the Grid will be charged for. And how will the administrative authority be centralized? </p> <p> Corporations have been slow to cotton to this new technology's potential, but the suits are in evidence at this year's Grid event. As GGF chairman Charlie Catlett noted, "This is the first time I've seen this many ties at a Grid forum." </p> <p> In addition to IBM, firms such as Boeing, Philips and Unilever are already taking baby steps toward the Grid. </p> <p> Though commercial needs tend to be more transaction-focused than those of scientific pursuits, most of the technical requirements are common. Furthermore, both science and industry participants say they require a level of reliability that's not offered by current peer-to-peer initiatives: Downloading from Napster, for example, can take seconds or minutes, or might not work at all. </p> <p> Garnering commercial interest is critical to the Grid's future. Cisco's Aiken explained that "if grids are really going to take off and become the major impetus for the next level of evolution in the Internet, we have to have something that allows (them) to easily transfer to industry." </p> <p> Other potential Grid components include creating a virtual observatory, and doctors performing simulations of blood flows. While some of these applications have existed for years, the Grid will make them routine rather than exceptional. </p> <p> The California Institute of Technology's Paul Messina said that by sharing computing resources, "you get more science from the same investment." </p> <p> Ian Foster of the University of Chicago said that Web precursor Arpanet was initially intended to be a distributed computing network that would share CPU-intensive tasks but instead wound up giving birth to e-mail and FTP. </p> <p> The Grid may give birth to a global file-swapping network or a members-only citadel for moneyed institutions. But just as no one ten years ago would have conceived of Napster -- not to mention AmIHotOrNot.com -- the future of the Grid is unknown. </p> <p> An associated DataGrid conference continues until Friday, focusing on a project in which resources from Pan-European research institutions will analyze data generated by a new particle collider being built at Swiss particle-physics lab CERN. </p>

    <h1>An Error Occurred Setting Your User Cookie</h1>

    <p>This site uses cookies to improve performance. If your browser does not accept cookies, you cannot view this site.</p>

    <h2>Setting Your Browser to Accept Cookies</h2>

    <p>There are many reasons why a cookie could not be set correctly. Below are the most common reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have cookies disabled in your browser. You need to reset your browser to accept cookies or to ask you if you want to accept cookies.</li>
        <li>Your browser asks you whether you want to accept cookies and you declined.
            To accept cookies from this site, use the Back button and accept the cookie.
        </li>
        <li>Your browser does not support cookies. Try a different browser if you suspect this.</li>
        <li>The date on your computer is in the past. If your computer's clock shows a date before 1 Jan 1970,
            the browser will automatically forget the cookie. To fix this, set the correct time and date on your computer.
        </li>
        <li>You have installed an application that monitors or blocks cookies from being set.
            You must disable the application while logging in or check with your system administrator.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Does this Site Require Cookies?</h2>

    <p>This site uses cookies to improve performance by remembering that you are logged in when you go from page to page. To provide access without cookies
        would require the site to create a new session for every page you visit, which slows the system down to an unacceptable level.
    </p>

    <h2>What Gets Stored in a Cookie?</h2>

    <p>This site stores nothing other than an automatically generated session ID in the cookie; no other information is captured.</p>

    <p>In general, only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a web site, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site
        cannot determine your email name unless you choose to type it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the
        rest of your computer, and only the site that created the cookie can read it.</p>
