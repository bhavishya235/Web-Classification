                    bridges the gap between raw mapping material and geographical information systems.
                    VPmap and VPmap pro provide professional interactive tools to create, georeference,
                    and edit spatial data and attribute information from scanned maps for transfer into
                    GIS. Simply convert raster maps into vector based maps, utilize intelligent attribute
                    definition functions, and add individual attributes. The VPmap Series will be targeted
                    at GIS applications, mainly to transfer scanned maps into ArcGIS (ESRI), MapInfo,
                    Autodesk Map etc. Thus, VPmap Series products contain GeoTIFF, Shapefile, and MIF
                    support for import and export explicitly to and from any common GIS platform <b>Raster
                        Conversion:</b> VPmap Series imports almost any raster file format. Just scan
                    your maps, or use satellite images as the first step to build up your geographical
                    information system (GIS). Both products contain easy, interactive tools to vectorize
                    and recognize outlines and even reduce the color depth by intelligent color handling.
                    In addition, VPmap pro offers functions for automatic vectorization and symbol recognition.
                    <b>Attribute Determination:</b> VPmap Series features sophisticated ways to simply
                    recognize shape-based geometrical information and convert them to geographical attributes
                    of entities. In addition you can define or import your own attribute tables and
                    fill them interactively. <b>Geographical Information Query:</b> VPmap Series enables
                    quick input of attribute-based queries. Results will be visually displayed in the
                    image or drawing. <b>Export:</b> VPmap Series offers export possibilities to the
                    most common GIS systems, like MapInfo, ArcGIS/ArcInfo, or Autodesk Map. Raster information
                    will be exported as well as entities an their attributs.<br>

        bridges the gap between raw mapping material and geographical information systems.
        VPmap and VPmap pro provide professional interactive tools to create, georeference,
        and edit spatial data and attribute information from scanned maps for transfer into
        GIS. Simply convert raster maps into vector based maps, utilize intelligent attribute
        definition functions, and add individual attributes. The VPmap Series will be targeted
        at GIS applications, mainly to transfer scanned maps into ArcGIS (ESRI), MapInfo,
        Autodesk Map etc. Thus, VPmap Series products contain GeoTIFF, Shapefile, and MIF
        support for import and export explicitly to and from any common GIS platform <b>Raster
            Conversion:</b> VPmap Series imports almost any raster file format. Just scan
        your maps, or use satellite images as the first step to build up your geographical
        information system (GIS). Both products contain easy, interactive tools to vectorize
        and recognize outlines and even reduce the color depth by intelligent color handling.
        In addition, VPmap pro offers functions for automatic vectorization and symbol recognition.
        <b>Attribute Determination:</b> VPmap Series features sophisticated ways to simply
        recognize shape-based geometrical information and convert them to geographical attributes
        of entities. In addition you can define or import your own attribute tables and
        fill them interactively. <b>Geographical Information Query:</b> VPmap Series enables
        quick input of attribute-based queries. Results will be visually displayed in the
        image or drawing. <b>Export:</b> VPmap Series offers export possibilities to the
        most common GIS systems, like MapInfo, ArcGIS/ArcInfo, or Autodesk Map. Raster information
        will be exported as well as entities an their attributs.<br>

                    </a>is an affordable solution for viewing, redlining and printing/plotting of 2D
                    drawings and scanned documents. Also, zooming, view rotation and panning is possible.
                    Even reviewing the properties of selected objects and CAD entities is possible!
                    File preview while browsing through directories and fast document loading is combined
                    with extensive zoom and pan features for quick image handling. Redlining is as easy
                    as picking a cloud or an arrow and placing it on the desired area. Viewing: Many
                    supported file formats, like almost any raster file (b/w, gray scale, color), vector,
                    hybrid file like RasterDWG, DWG, DXF, RVD or others can be previewed and loaded
                    in a blink. Comfortable and fast zoom and pan functions allow for detailed inspection.
                    If redlining is activated, all accessible redlining information will be displayed.
                    Printing/Plotting: VPview features sophisticated print and plot functions for raster,
                    vector, and hybrid files. The image may be plotted up to its extents or any scaling
                    factor. The plot preview allows for exact positioning and window selection. File
                    Comparison: VPview enables quick and visual comparison of different files and drawing
                    versions. Just load a second file and the difference will be highlighted! Redlining/Reviewing/Mark-ups:
                    VPview offers easy to use pre-designed redlining objects ready to be placed on the
                    drawing. The user is automatically requested to add a headline text for free placement
                    anywhere around the redlining marker for optimal visibility. Additional text - for
                    more detailed information or instructions - can be entered into a text box which
                    will be displayed whenever the corresponding redline marker is called up. The redlining
                    information can be exported separately. Each authorized redlining user is assigned
                    to his own redlining entities. His activities are recorded by name and date. Distinctive
                    rights assigned to a user regulate to either view the redlining elements, to create
                    new redlining comments, or to check or to remove redlining markers and comments
                    - usually for managers in a control position. This hierarchy is designed to fulfill
                    workflow demands of structured organizations and those operating on a global scale.<br>

<p><a href="r2v.html">R2V</a> is an advanced raster to vector
conversion software for automated map digitizing, GIS data capture and
CAD conversion applications. R2V is currently being used in more than
60 countries by thousands of users for mapping and GIS data conversion
applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p> R2V supports fully automatic vectorization and interactive line
tracing from scanned maps and drawings. R2V inputs bi-level, grayscale,
and color images in TIFF, GeoTIFF, GIF, JPEG, RLC, PNG or BMP
formats.&nbsp; It exports vector data to ArcView Shapefiles, Arc/Info
Generate, MapInfo MIF/MID, AutoCAD DXF, IGES, STL, VRML, SVG (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/intro.html"> Scalable Vector Graphics</a>)
and MapGuide SDL formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>R2V provides complete on-screen image and vector editing, labeling,
and geo-referencing using GeoTIFF or user specified control points,
image rubber sheeting, color image classification and separation, text
symbol detection and recognition (OCR), automatic polygon layer
creation, 3D DEM and Grid creation, and 3D display and image draping.
R2V is currently being used in more than 60 countries for mapping and
GIS database creation applications.</p>

					<p>Welcome to AutoTrace - a program for converting bitmap to vector graphics.<br>
						The aim of the AutoTrace project is the development of a freely available

						hope that it will become better than all commercially available programs. In 
						some aspects it is already better.
						<br>
						AutoTrace is free software. AutoTrace is distributed under the term of GNU GPL.

					<p>I invite you to participate in the AutoTrace project. First, if you plan to

					<ul>
						<li>
							Core:
							<br>
							- Speed up<br>
							- Improve tracing quality<br>
							- Bugs?!<br>
							- Recognition of Circle and Ellipse pieces.<br>
							- Addition of code to recognize lines, splines and circles even if there is a 
							lot of noise<br>
							- Currently pictures have to fit completely into memory<br>
							- New algorithm to work best with antialiased pictures<br>
							- 3D recognition<br>
							- Better list management, that means the current generation of lists is time 
							consuming and fragmentates the heap.<br>
							- Outlines are traced two times that means that it could be faster and if we 
							trace and fit every outline only once we will not have the problems with 
							unwanted gaps anymore.<br>
							- Better thinning algorithm like CAT (Chordal Axis Transformation)<br>
						<li>
							Input:<br>
							- Mirgrate new plug-in interface with using glib(0.32)<br>
							- Support of image libraries as freeimage, gdk-pixbuf or paintlib(0.32)<br>
						<li>
							Output:<br>
							- Mirgrate new plug-in interface with using glib(0.32)<br>
							- New export formats like wmf, cdr, cmx, compressed pdf, compressed svg and dxf 
							with splines...<br>
						<li>
							Library and its clients:<br>
							- Graphical userinterface<br>
							-- For gnome/gtk, frontline is under developing.<br>
							(See <a href="http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/frontline">http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/frontline</a>. 
							It works well with sodipodi, a drawing editor.)<br>

<h2>The easiest way to convert images to line art</h2>
<br>
Faster than a tracing hand, this powerful software is the raster to
vector converter you need for Illustrator (Adobe), CorelDraw (Corel),
Flash (Macromedia), Mobile Designer (Beatware), Swish, Inkscape
(freeware) and any vector-based software.<br>
<br>
VectorEye instantly converts scanned black-and-white or color raster
images (bmp, jpg, tiff, png) into editable vector files (svg, ps, eps)
and now (release 3)&nbsp;Flash or Xaml for Windows Vista.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"></span>Just scan any sketch, or select an image, make some bitmap adjustements
(scale, select zone, enhance, swap
colors, rotate...) and VectorEye will automatically create multiple
file corresponding to differents settings. You can analyse, modify till
the result suits you (quality, weight, number of vectors).<br>
<br>
Just save it in the appropriate format for your purpose and drop into
your favorite vector editor or authoring tool to complete or animate
your design. You could also use the batch system to launch hundreds of
vectorization processes.<br>
<br>
<span class="gras">Our third release has some great new
features as a
new vectorisation
algorithm for line detection.
The gui is also new and Vectoreye has now a flash export&nbsp;and
a&nbsp;xaml export for
Windows Vista,</span><br>

Cutting Shop</b> is the premier 32 bit raster to vector conversion program
for all cutting applications. The program imports color, gray and black
and white images.&nbsp; Cutting Shop is simple to install, easy to use
and extremely fast.&nbsp; Scans of both sketches and silhouettes are quickly
converted into high quality, ready to cut, vector drawings.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>Any
TrueType font is instantly outlined with long lines and arcs.&nbsp; Whether
it is a vectorized drawing or an outlined font, complex curves are made
of a series of end to end arcs and outlines are closed polygons.&nbsp;

<h2><img src="image/h_vextr.gif" alt="Vextractor. Raster to vector convertion sofrware."></h2>

<p>
<b>Vextractor</b> is a professional software for converting raster images to vector (vectorizer).
Vextractor converts drawings, maps and other images, including photo, logos, black-and-white 
illustrations from raster to vector format.
The program can save converted raster images to the following vector formats: 
DXF, WMF, EMF, EPS, AI or SVG. Files of these vector formats can be imported to popular 
vector graphics applications like AutoCAD, Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator, and many others.  
For the purpose of supporting GIS applications, the program allows saving images to the 
ArcInfo Shape and MapInfo MID/MIF formats.
This software is a perfect replacement for the traditional tracing and digitizing. 
It can save lots of your time, for it is much quicker to use this program rather than do 
the tracing by hand or using a digitizer. 
</p>


<h2>Why Do You Need Vextractor?</h2>

<p>
Chances are these days you can open raster files (e.g., BMP, TIFF, PNG, JPG) with your 
favorite CAD program - the majority of modern CAD programs can import and display 
raster images. However, as soon as you import your raster file in your CAD program, 
you will find out that all you can do with it is just view it and trace it over. 
You are unable to modify or edit the raster as easily as you can do vector data.
That takes place because CAD software can only work with vector files. If you want 
to edit raster files in a CAD application you are to convert them to vector files first. 
That can be done with a raster to vector conversion program (vectorizer).
Once your raster image is converted to the vector format, you will be able to import 
it in your CAD application and then edit it like any other drawings that you do 
with your CAD application.
</p>
<p>
The list below summarizes the conversion of hard-copy drawings to CAD drawings, 
using the raster to vector converter:
</p>

<p>1. Create a raster file by scanning a hard-copy drawing with a scanner.</p>
<p>2. Use Vextractor to convert the raster file to the vector format.</p>
<p>3. Import the vector file to your CAD application.</p>
<p>4. Edit the drawing in your CAD application.</p>

<p>
Vextractor can replace the traditional tracing and digitizing applications. 
It offers a simple and easy way to convert paper-based drawings to CAD drawings 
for further editing and use. Vextractor will save many hours of your time 
and free you from the boring and monotonous work. 
</p>

<h2>Vextractor Usage Examples:</h2>

<p>1. Suppose you have an archive of a great number of raster drawings, pictures or logos, 
which you can only view and print. The possibility to convert that data to the vector 
format would be very helpful for your work.
</p>
<p>2. Desktop small-format (A4) scanners are very popular today. Multitudes of CAD 
professionals have the need for scanning drawings and then converting them for 
editing in CAD applications. Now you can convert hand-made machine-building, 
electro-technical or architecture drawings to your CAD application and save them to disk.
</p>
<p>3. If you have a hardcopy or raster image (photo), and you want to engrave a 
3D inscription, logo or image on the metal, wood or plastic. Now you can 
convert the raster file to the input format (usually, dxf) for a CNC cutting 
or router system.
</p>

<h2>Converting Raster Images to the Vector Format with Vextractor</h2>

<p>
If you want to check whether Vextractor will work for you - try it for converting your 
scanned images to the vector format.
You can do that even with the demo version of Vextractor. It allows reading your raster 
files and converting them.
</p>

<p>
As soon as you see the conversion results, you will be able to tell, what is faster: 
edit the converted image in a vector editor or draw it by hand from a scratch.
If you use Vextractor, it is normally quicker to vectorize a raster image and then 
edit the result than trace and digitize the entire drawing from the scratch. 
Quite often, the quality of the original hardcopy or raster is obviously insufficient 
for the precise conversion to the vector format. In such case, you can use the collection 
of special raster filters implemented in Vextractor for the preparation of raster images 
to vectorizing. With filters like median, despeckle, remove isolated spots or gaussian 
smoothing you can sufficiently improve the quality of the original image. 
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, in spite of all efforts, the quality of the original scanned drawing makes 
the vectorizing and the further editing literally impossible. The automatic vectorizing 
is not perfect. That is true for all raster-to-vector conversion applications; not a single 
solution guarantees the 100% result. However, it does work and allows inputting a hard-copy 
drawing to CAD for the further quick and easy editing. It does not promise the irreproachable 
results at all times; nevertheless, it is a very useful tool for your work. 
</p>

<h2>Vextractor's Advanced Features</h2>

<p>
The program has all tools necessary for viewing images: scaling, scrolling, and color selection. 
Vextractor features: TWAIN support for importing images from any scanner; automatic 
recognition of orthogonal lines, arcs, and circles; saving the original drawing's scale. 
Vextractor can convert halftone and color images to black-and-white images for further 
recognition; it can rotate and change the orientation of raster images. 
</p>
<p>
Vextractor has a built-in vector editor, which can be used for the editing of 
vectorization results. The program can create curves using Bezier splines, which 
allow obtaining images smoother than the original raster. By picking specific 
optimal parameters, you can obtain an image of curves, which look greater than 
the original image. 
</p>

<p>
The program also can be used for the digitizing of function graphs to be used in MS Excel 
and other mathematical applications. The special text format ASCII XYZ with a very simple 
structure is provided for importing to such applications. 
</p>

<p>
GIS professionals can use Vextractor's functions for digitizing hardcopy maps. 
The vectorizer supports such GIS formats as ArcInfo shape files and MapInfo MID/MIF. 
Specially for GIS users, the program has the capability of georeferencing raster 
images by points with known coordinates. The referencing via GeoTIFF and ArcInfo/ArcView 
World-files is also supported.

	The professional version is for people who want more processing options and finer control over the vectorisation process.
	WinTopo Pro includes many options for pre-processing the raster image to get the optimum vectorisation result.
	It also benefits from a more advanced vectorisation engine which has resulted from our many
	years of expertise in programming, engineering and image processing.
