<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">1. Introduction</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">ProSpur+ is a professional program designed to create drawings of spur gears.The drawings are produced as symbols for the ProCAD+ Computer Aided Design package for use on Acorn RISC computers.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The shape of a gear is not easy to draw as it involves what are known as involute curves. ProSpur+ can not only produce these curves, it can actually produce isometric projections of them so that &quot;exploded gear-boxes&quot; can be drawn very quickly. Elevations and cross-sections are also provided.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This guide assumes that the user is familiar with gears and the terms involved, and also is conversant with the use of the ProCAD+ program. The guide has been written to conform to the style and layout of the ProCAD+ manual in order to reduce the learning time. A glossary appears towards the end of the guide to explain some of the gear terms. A full explanation of the terms used by gear manufacturers can usually be found in most good machinery handbooks.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As supplied, ProSpur+ creates gears according to British practice, but it may be customized to work to any other standard. A section of the manual is dedicated to customizing the program to fit specific requirements.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">ProSpur+ fully supports the !Help utility in order to provide extra information on the use of the various icons on the main dialogue box.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">2. Using ProSpur+</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For the installation of ProSpur+ it is advisable to copy the !ProSpur+ application to a convenient directory on the hard disc.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">ProSpur+ is supplied ready to run. Once you are used to using it, you may, however, wish to make some adjustments to its settings. This is discussed in section 3.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Run ProSpur+ in the usual way, by double clicking on the !ProSpur+ icon. Its icon will appear on the icon bar and the main dialogue box will be displayed as shown in figure 1.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Clicking the middle Menu mouse button over the icon-bar icon will bring up a menu consisting of Info. and Quit. Info. leads to a box displaying information relating to the program's version, serial number and copyright. Quit removes the main dialogue box and quits the program in the usual way.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Clicking the left Select mouse button over the icon-bar icon will open the main dialogue box if it was closed, otherwise it will bring the dialogue box to the front.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The main dialogue box is the window in which the data will be entered to specify the gear. Clicking on its close icon will close it without quitting ProSpur+. Simply click Select on the ProSpur+ icon-bar icon to re-open it.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Clicking Select on the close icon while holding down the Shift key will iconize the dialogue box on the RISC-OS pinboard. Double click on it in the usual way to restore it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/fig1.jpg" ALT="Figure 1." ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="415" HEIGHT="383" BORDER="0"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Symbol Name</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The ultimate goal of ProSpur+ is to produce a ProCAD+ file containing gear symbols. These symbols must have names. The first writable icon in the dialogue box contains the symbol name. When the name ends with a number it will be incremented once the symbol file has been saved. (This feature may be turned off. See section 3.) The incrementing feature helps to avoid the duplication of symbol names, as ProCAD+ identifies symbols by their unique names.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Below the symbol name are three radio-type buttons that allow the selection of the way in which the data are to be interpreted. The writable icon opposite &quot;Module&quot; will contain the actual value.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Diametral Pitch</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Diametral Pitch is probably the most common way of specifying a gear for British and American use. It is defined as the ratio of the number of teeth to the number of inches in the pitch circle diameter. When this option is selected the units for all other length measurement default to inch units.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Circular Pitch</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Circular Pitch is the distance along the circumference of the pitch circle between corresponding points on adjacent teeth. When this option is selected the units for all other length measurement default to inch units.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Module</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Metric Module, or Module, as it has now come to be known, is the ratio of the pitch circle diameter in millimetres to the number of teeth. When this option is selected the units for all other length measurement default to millimetre units. The units shown in parentheses beside length measurements will also change to show this.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">NOTE: When entering length data in writable icons the units shown in parentheses are the default units if none are specified with the data value. Alternatively, in or &quot; or mm may be appended to the value to over-ride the default and specify the actual units intended (inches or millimetres only).</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Pressure Angle</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The pressure angle is fully described in the glossary. For most British and American practice an angle of either 14&frac12;&deg; or 20&deg; is used. (ProSpur+ can use other angles if needed. See section 3.)</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Pitch Circle Diameter</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Pitch Circle Diameter specifies the diameter of the circle through the pitch point, having its centre at the axis of the gear. Pitch circles of meshing gears should touch tangentially.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Gear Width</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is the width or thickness of the gear. If no side views, sections or isometric views are required then this value may be left blank.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Bore Diameter</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is the diameter of the hole in the middle of the gear. If the hole is to be tapered then this diameter is measured at the front face unless a front boss is to be used, in which case this is the diameter at the outer edge of the boss. In other words, it is always the diameter at the front of the whole gear.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Bore Taper</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Leave this value empty or zero if no taper is required. If a tapered bore is required then enter a value in degrees or as a ratio eg: 1:10. A positive taper reduces the bore from front to back. A negative taper may be used to increase the bore from front to back. Tapers causing holes to close or bosses to be cut will display an error message.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Rotation Angle</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The gear symbol is normally created so that the centre of a tooth is at the 0&deg; position. The rotation angle permits the whole symbol to be defined rotated by this amount. This is not the same as rotating the symbol in ProCAD+ as the rotation is shown in all the projections for the additional views that ProSpur+ can provide.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Helical Angle</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This should be left at 0 unless a helical gear is required. The button to the left of the writable switches between right and left hand.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Boss Diameter</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If no bosses are required, simply leave this entry empty. ProSpur+ can, however, provide for either one or two bosses. If a single value is entered here it is taken as the diameter of the front boss. A second value may be entered after a comma to denote the diameter of the second, back boss. If a back boss is required but no front boss then enter zero followed by a comma and then the second boss diameter.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Boss Height</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As for the boss diameters the boss heights may be separated by a comma. Two boss diameters will require two boss heights.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Teeth</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The box marked Teeth is not used for data entry. It is for information. If the data has been entered for Diametral Pitch or its equivalent and the Pitch Circle Diameter then clicking on this box will cause the number of teeth to be shown, calculated from the entered values. The number of teeth is also updated when OK is clicked.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Views</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Normally ProSpur+ creates a symbol that shows the side of the gear that displays the profile of the teeth. Other views may be selected by turning on the following buttons by clicking on them.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Above</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This option provides an extra view as a symbol using the entered name, preceded by A_. The view is as from above the original view, using third angle projection. The tips of the teeth will be projected into the view and any bosses will be shown. The bore will be shown as a short-dash line.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Below</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This option provides an extra view as a symbol using the entered name, preceded by B_. The view is as from below the original view, using third angle projection. The tips of the teeth will be projected into the view and any bosses will be shown. The bore will be shown as a short-dash line.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Left</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This option provides an extra view as a symbol using the entered name, preceded by L_. The view is as from the left of the original view, using third angle projection. The tips of the teeth will be projected into the view and any bosses will be shown. The bore will be shown as a short-dash line.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Right</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This option provides an extra view as a symbol using the entered name, preceded by R_. The view is as from the right of the original view, using third angle projection. The tips of the teeth will be projected into the view and any bosses will be shown. The bore will be shown as a short-dash line.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Section</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This option provides a cross-section view as a symbol using the entered name, preceded by S_. The view is a cross-section cut through the gear including the bosses. The cut portions will be filled with standard hatching. (The hatching may be altered. See section 3.)</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Isometric</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This option provides an isometric view as a symbol using the entered name, preceded by I_. The view is as from the front of the original view with the top tipped away from the viewer. All hidden detail will be removed. The second or back boss will not be shown.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Pitch Circle</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This switch controls the drawing of the chain line circle that marks the pitch in the standard side view (and the equivalent ellipse in the isometric view). If the circle is not required simply turn this switch off.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Tooth Symbol</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Normally ProSpur+ creates the symbol for the standard view by repeating a tooth symbol, rotated around the pitch circle. The tooth symbol has the name entered preceded by T_ for its name. If, for any reason, it is necessary to change the appearance of the teeth then modifying this one tooth symbol will cause them all to change. Sometimes the standard symbol is easier to edit if its teeth are made up of lines instead of symbols. If this is required then turn the Tooth Symbol switch off. Isometric projections do not use tooth symbols as the projection of each tooth is different.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">OK</H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Before clicking on OK check that all the relevant values have been entered and that the directory view to receive the file is visible. Alternatively, it is possible to drop the file directly on to a ProCAD+ drawing in a ProCAD+ window. If the second option is chosen then it will be necessary to check that the symbol names have not already been used on the drawing by looking at the contents of the ProCAD+ symbol tool dialogue box.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When OK is clicked the data are checked and any errors will be reported. The number of teeth will be shown in the &quot;Teeth&quot; box. If no errors are detected then a &quot;Save as&quot; dialogue box will appear that will allow the newly created file of symbols to be saved.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once the symbols have been created they may be used directly in ProCAD+ on any drawing. The gears are always created full size and so may need scaling to comply with certain drawings. This may be done by scaling the symbols using the symbol tool dialogue box or by using the Transform option on the ProCAD+ Select menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Only one isometric view is provided as the other two views may be obtained by rotating the same symbol through 120&deg; and 240&deg;. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If a symbol needs to be cut or edited then it should be converted to a group first. If tooth symbols are used then these will need to be converted to groups as well.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">3. Customizing ProSpur+</H2>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">ProSpur+ is supplied ready to use but it may be customized by editing the file called Params inside the !ProSpur+ application. In order to get at this file hold the Shift key down while double clicking Select on the !ProSpur+ icon in the directory viewer. This will open the application's directory viewer and the Params file should be visible. Load this into !Edit and make what alterations are needed. Save the file when editing is complete and then re-load ProSpur+ on the icon-bar with the new parameters. Below is a list of all the parameters in alphabetical order, along with their meanings and default settings. The glossary in the next section may help with the explanation of some of the more unusual terms.</P>

  2003. Version 2.02h released. Adds a few minor bug-fixes. 17 Jan. 2002.
  Version 20.2g. Corrects a (minor) zero-pointer error. 13 Nov. 2000. Version
  2.02f is now available. It and versions 2.02c-d incorporate a few minor
  corrections (see the readme file). 20. Sept. 1999. Version 2.02b is now
  available and includes support for displaying punch tip force in US tons as
  well as kN (kilo-Newtons). Note that there is a new form file field,
  {$forceunit}, that will cause the correct unit name to be printed on the
  technical drawings. If tons are used one must make certain that the text kN
  is not hardcoded in the form file. See the form files included with the new
  version to see how to use {$forceunit}. You will only need to make changes if
  you are using your own version of a form file from an earlier version of
  TabletCAD.</span> <br>
  <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is
  also a <b>new version</b> of the <b>demo</b> program, where a small error has
  been corrected (in the options window it was not possible to go past the
  default form-file using the down arrow).</span> </p>
