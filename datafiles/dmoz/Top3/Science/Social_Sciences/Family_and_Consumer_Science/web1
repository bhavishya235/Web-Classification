	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/

}

	background: #DDDDDD;

	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margin of the last element in the #header div will avoid margin collapse - an unexplainable space between divs. If the div has a border around it, this is not necessary as that also avoids the margin collapse */
	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left;
	width: 16em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
	padding-top: 15px;
	padding-right: 0;
	padding-bottom: 15px;

.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
	color: #333;
	text-align: center;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.

      </ul>
</div>
    <center>
      <div align="left">
        <p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS">One &quot;official&quot; definition of consumer behavior is &quot;The study of individuals, groups, or organizations and the processes they use to select, secure, use, and dispose of products, services, experiences, or ideas to satisfy needs and the impacts that these processes have on the consumer and society.&quot; Although it is not necessary to memorize this definition, it brings up some useful points:</font></p>
</div>
    </center>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Behavior occurs either for the individual, or in the context of a group (e.g., friends influence what kinds of clothes a person wears) or an organization (people on the job make decisions as to which products the firm should use).</font></li>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Consumer behavior involves the use and disposal of products as well as the study of how they are purchased. Product use is often of great interest to the marketer, because this may influence how a product is best positioned or how we can encourage increased consumption. Since many environmental problems result from product disposal (e.g., motor oil being sent into sewage systems to save the recycling fee, or garbage piling up at landfills) this is also an area of interest.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">Consumer behavior involves services and ideas as well as tangible products.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">The impact of consumer behavior on society is also of relevance. For example, aggressive marketing of high fat foods, or aggressive marketing of easy credit, may have serious repercussions for the national health and economy.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">There are four main applications of consumer behavior:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">The most obvious is for <i>marketing strategy</i>&mdash;i.e., for making better marketing campaigns. For example, by understanding that consumers are more receptive to food advertising when they are hungry, we learn to schedule snack advertisements late in the afternoon. By understanding that new products are usually initially adopted by a few consumers and only spread later, and then only gradually, to the rest of the population, we learn that (1) companies that introduce new products must be well financed so that they can stay afloat until their products become a commercial success and (2) it is important to please initial customers, since they will in turn influence many subsequent customers&rsquo; brand choices.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">A second application is <i>public policy</i>. In the 1980s, Accutane, a near miracle cure for acne, was introduced. Unfortunately, Accutane resulted in severe birth defects if taken by pregnant women. Although physicians were instructed to warn their female patients of this, a number still became pregnant while taking the drug. To get consumers&rsquo; attention, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) took the step of requiring that very graphic pictures of deformed babies be shown on the medicine containers.</font></li>
      <li> <i><font face="Trebuchet MS">Social marketing</font></i><font face="Trebuchet MS"> involves getting ideas across to consumers rather than selling something. Marty Fishbein, a marketing professor, went on sabbatical to work for the Centers for Disease Control trying to reduce the incidence of transmission of diseases through illegal drug use. The best solution, obviously, would be if we could get illegal drug users to stop. This, however, was deemed to be infeasible. It was also determined that the practice of sharing needles was too ingrained in the drug culture to be stopped. As a result, using knowledge of consumer attitudes, Dr. Fishbein created a campaign that encouraged the cleaning of needles in bleach before sharing them, a goal that was believed to be more realistic.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Trebuchet MS">As a final benefit, studying consumer behavior should make us better consumers. Common sense suggests, for example, that if you buy a 64 liquid ounce bottle of laundry detergent, you should pay less per ounce than if you bought two 32 ounce bottles. In practice, however, you often pay a size <i>premium</i> by buying the larger quantity. In other words, in this case, knowing this fact will sensitize you to the need to check the unit cost labels to determine if you are <i>really</i> getting a bargain.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">There are several units in the market that can be analyzed. Our main thrust in this course is the <i>consumer</i>. However, we will also need to analyze our own firm&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses and those of <i>competing firms</i>. Suppose, for example, that we make a product aimed at older consumers, a growing segment. A competing firm that targets babies, a shrinking market, is likely to consider repositioning toward our market. To assess a competing firm&rsquo;s potential threat, we need to examine its assets (e.g., technology, patents, market knowledge, awareness of its brands) against pressures it faces from the market. Finally, we need to assess conditions (the marketing environment). For example, although we may have developed a product that offers great appeal for consumers, a recession may cut demand dramatically.</font></p>
    <h1 class="style4"><b><font face="Trebuchet MS"><br />
          <a href="cb_Research_Methods.html">Consumer Research Methods</a></font></b></h1>
    <p><strong>Market  research</strong> is often needed to ensure that we produce what customers really want and not  what we <em>think</em> they want.</p>
    <p><strong>Primary  vs. secondary research methods</strong>.   There are two main approaches to marketing.  <em>Secondary </em> research involves using information  that others have already put together.   For example, if you are thinking about starting a business making  clothes for tall people, you don’t need to question people about how tall they  are to find out how many tall people exist—that information has already been  published by the U.S. Government.  <em>Primary </em>research, in contrast, is  research that you design and conduct yourself.   For example, you may need to find out whether consumers would prefer  that your soft drinks be sweater or tarter.</p>
    <p>Research will often help us <em>reduce risks</em> associated with a new  product, but it <em>cannot take the risk away  entirely</em>.  It is also important to  ascertain whether the research has been complete.  For example, Coca Cola did a great deal of  research prior to releasing the New Coke, and consumers seemed to prefer the  taste.  However, consumers were <em>not</em> prepared to have this drink replace  traditional Coke.</p>
    <p><strong>Secondary  Methods</strong>.  For more information about <a href="PDF/Secondary_Sources--F11.pdf" target="_blank">secondary market  research</a> tools and issues, please see my <a href="PDF/Secondary_Sources--F11.pdf" target="_blank">handout</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Primary  Methods</strong>.  Several tools are available to the market researcher—e.g., mail questionnaires,  phone surveys, observation, and focus groups.   Please see <a href="PDF/Research_Methods.pdf" target="_blank">my handout</a><a href="http://buad307.com/PDF/ResearchMethods.pdf"></a> for advantages and disadvantages of each. The <a href="PDF/Research_Method_Choice.pdf" target="_blank">below flow chart</a> suggests appropriate choices for different types of information needs.</p>

    <p align="center"><a href="images/Choosing_a_Research_Method--large.jpg">Please click for a larger version of the chart</a></p>
    <p><em>Surveys</em> are  useful for getting a great deal of specific information.  Surveys can contain open-ended questions  (e.g., “In which city and state were you born? ____________”) or closed-ended,  where the respondent is asked to select answers from a brief list (e.g.,  “__Male ___ Female.”  Open ended  questions have the advantage that the respondent is not limited to the options  listed, and that the respondent is not being influenced by seeing a list of  responses.  However, open-ended questions  are often skipped by respondents, and coding them can be quite a  challenge.  In general, for surveys to  yield meaningful responses, sample sizes of over 100 are usually required  because precision is essential.  For  example, if a market share of twenty percent would result in a loss while  thirty percent would be profitable, a confidence interval of 20-35% is too wide  to be useful.</p>
    <p>Surveys come in several  different forms.  Mail surveys are  relatively inexpensive, but response rates are typically quite low—typically  from 5-20%.  Phone-surveys get somewhat  higher response rates, but not many questions can be asked because many answer  options have to be repeated and few people are willing to stay on the phone for  more than five minutes.  Mall intercepts  are a convenient way to reach consumers, but respondents may be reluctant to  discuss anything sensitive face-to-face with an interviewer.</p>
    <p>Surveys, as any kind of research,  are vulnerable to bias.  The wording of a  question can influence the outcome a great deal.  For example, more people answered no to the  question “Should speeches against democracy be allowed?” than answered yes to  “Should speeches against democracy be forbidden?”  For face-to-face interviews, interviewer bias  is a danger, too.  Interviewer bias  occurs when the interviewer influences the way the respondent answers.  For example, unconsciously an interviewer  that works for the firm manufacturing the product in question may smile a  little when something good is being said about the product and frown a little  when something negative is being said.   The respondent may catch on and say something more positive than his or  her real opinion.  Finally, a response  bias may occur—if only part of the sample responds to a survey, the  respondents’ answers may not be representative of the population.</p>
    <p><em>Focus  groups</em> are useful when the marketer wants to launch a new product or modify an  existing one.  A focus group usually  involves having some 8-12 people come together in a room to discuss their  consumption preferences and experiences.   The group is usually led by a moderator, who will start out talking  broadly about topics <em>related broadly</em> to the product without mentioning the product itself.  For example, a focus group aimed at  sugar-free cookies might first address consumers’ snacking preferences, only  gradually moving toward the specific product of sugar-free cookies.  By not mentioning the product up front, we  avoid biasing the participants into thinking only in terms of the specific  product brought out.   Thus, instead of  having consumers think primarily in terms of what might be good or bad about  the product, we can ask them to discuss more broadly the ultimate benefits they  really seek.  For example, instead of  having consumers merely discuss what they think about some sugar-free cookies  that we are considering releasing to the market, we can have consumers speak  about their motivations for using snacks and what general kinds of benefits  they seek.  Such a discussion might  reveal a concern about healthfulness and a desire for wholesome foods.  Probing on the meaning of wholesomeness,  consumers might indicate a desire to avoid artificial ingredients.  This would be an important concern in the  marketing of sugar-free cookies, but might not have come up if consumers were  asked to comment directly on the product where the use of artificial  ingredients is, by virtue of the nature of the product, necessary.</p>
    <p>Focus groups are well suited for some  purposes, but <em>poorly suited for others</em>.  In general, focus groups <em>are very good for getting breadth</em>—i.e., finding out what kinds of <em>issues</em> are important for consumers in a  given product category.  Here, it is  helpful that focus groups are completely “open-ended:” The consumer mentions  his or her preferences and opinions, and the focus group moderator can ask the  consumer to elaborate.  In a  questionnaire, if one did not think to ask about something, chances are that  few consumers would take the time to write out an elaborate answer.  Focus groups also have some drawbacks, for  example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They  represent <em>small sample sizes</em>.  Because of the cost of running focus groups,  only a few groups can be run.  Suppose  you run four focus groups with ten members each. This will result in an <em>n</em> of 4(10)=40, which is too small to  generalize from.  Therefore, focus groups <em>cannot</em> give us a good idea of:</li>
      <li>What  proportion of the population is likely to buy the product.</li>
      <li>What  price consumers are willing to pay.</li>
      <li>The  groups are inherently <em>social</em>.  This means that:</li>
      <li>Consumers  will often say things that may make them look good (i.e., they watch public  television rather than soap operas or cook fresh meals for their families  daily) even if that is not true.</li>
      <li>Consumers  may be reluctant to speak about embarrassing issues (e.g., weight control,  birth control).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Personal interviews</em> involve in-depth questioning of an individual about his or her  interest in or experiences with a product.   The benefit here is that we can get really into depth (when the  respondent says something interesting, we can ask him or her to elaborate), but  this method of research is costly and can be extremely vulnerable to  interviewer bias.</p>
    <p>To get a person to elaborate,  it may help to try a common tool of psychologists and psychiatrists—simply  repeating what the person said.  He or  she will often become uncomfortable with the silence that follows and will then  tend to elaborate.  This approach has the  benefit that it minimizes the interference with the respondent’s own ideas and  thoughts.  He or she is not influenced by  a new question but will, instead, go more in depth on what he or she was  saying.</p>
    <p>Personal interviews are  highly susceptible to inadvertent “signaling” to the respondent.  Although an interviewer is looking to get at  the truth, he or she may have a significant interest in a positive consumer  response.  Unconsciously, then, he or she  may inadvertently smile a little when something positive is said and frown a  little when something negative is said.   Consciously, this will often not be noticeable, and the respondent often  will not consciously be aware that he or she is being “reinforced” and  “punished” for saying positive or negative things, but at an unconscious level,  the cumulative effect of several facial expressions are likely to be felt.  Although this type of conditioning will not  get a completely negative respondent to say all positive things, it may “swing”  the balance a bit so that respondents are more likely to say positive thoughts  and withhold, or limit the duration of, negative thoughts.</p>
    <p><em>Projective techniques</em> are used when a consumer may feel embarrassed to  admit to certain opinions, feelings, or preferences.  For example, many older executives may not be  comfortable admitting to being intimidated by computers.   It has been found that in such cases, people  will tend to respond more openly about “someone else.”  Thus, we may ask them to explain reasons why <em>a friend</em> has not yet bought a computer,  or to tell a story about a <em>person in a picture</em> who is or is not using a product.  The  main problem with this method is that it is difficult to analyze responses.</p>
    <p>Projective techniques are  inherently inefficient to use.  The  elaborate context that has to be put into place takes time and energy away from  the main question.  There may also  be real differences between the respondent  and the third party.  Saying or thinking  about something that “hits too close to home” may also influence the  respondent, who may or may not be able to see through the ruse.</p>
    <p><em>Observation</em> of consumers is often a powerful tool.   Looking at how consumers select products may yield insights into how  they make decisions and what they look for.   For example, some American manufacturers were concerned about low sales  of their products in Japan.  Observing Japanese consumers, it was found  that many of these Japanese consumers scrutinized packages looking for a name  of a major manufacturer—the product specific-brands that are common in the U.S.  (e.g., Tide) were not impressive to the Japanese, who wanted a name of a major  firm like Mitsubishi or Proctor &amp; Gamble.   Observation may help us determine how much time consumers spend  comparing prices, or whether nutritional labels are being consulted.</p>
    <p>A question arises as to  whether this type of “spying” inappropriately invades the privacy of  consumers.   Although there may be cause  for some concern in that the particular individuals have not consented to be  part of this research, it should be noted that there is no particular interest  in what the individual customer being watched does.  The question is what consumers—either as an  entire group or as segments—do.   Consumers benefit, for example, from stores that are designed  effectively to promote efficient shopping.   If it is found that women are more uncomfortable than men about others  standing too close, the areas of the store heavily trafficked by women can be  designed accordingly.  What is being  reported here, then, are averages and tendencies in response.  The intent is not to find “juicy”  observations specific to one customer.</p>
    <p>The video clip with Paco  Underhill that we saw in class demonstrated the application of observation  research to the retail setting.  By  understanding the phenomena such as the tendency toward a right turn, the location  of merchandise can be observed.  It is  also possible to identify problem areas where customers may be overly  vulnerable to the “but brush,” or overly close encounter with others.  This method can be used to identify problems  that the customer experiences, such as difficulty finding a product, a mirror,  a changing room, or a store employee for help.</p>
    <p><em>Online research methods</em>.  The Internet  now reaches the great majority of households in the U.S., and thus, online research  provides new opportunity and has increased in use.</p>
    <p>One potential benefit of  online surveys is the use of “conditional branching.”  In conventional paper and pencil surveys, one  question might ask if the respondent has shopped for a new car during the last  eight months.  If the respondent answers  “no,” he or she will be asked to skip ahead several questions—e.g., going  straight to question 17 instead of proceeding to number 9.  If the respondent answered “yes,” he or she  would be instructed to go to the next question which, along with the next  several ones, would address issues related to this shopping experience.  Conditional branching allows the computer to  skip directly to the appropriate question.   If a respondent is asked which brands he or she considered, it is also  possible to customize brand comparison questions to those listed.  Suppose, for example, that the respondent  considered Ford, Toyota, and Hyundai, it would be possible to ask the subject  questions about his or her view of the relative quality of each respective  pair—in this case, Ford vs. Toyota, Ford vs. Hyundai, and Toyota vs. Hyundai.</p>
    <p>There are certain drawbacks  to online surveys. Some consumers may be more comfortable with online  activities than others—and not all households will have access.  Today, however, this type of response bias is  probably not significantly greater than that associated with other types of  research methods.  A more serious problem  is that it has consistently been found in online research that it is very difficult—if  not impossible—to get respondents to carefully read instructions and other  information online—there is a tendency to move quickly.  This makes it difficult to perform research  that depends on the respondent’s reading of a situation or product description.</p>
    <p>Online search data and page  visit logs provides valuable ground for analysis.  It is possible to see how frequently various  terms are used by those who use a firm’s web site search feature or to see the  route taken by most consumers to get to the page with the information they ultimately  want.  If consumers use a certain term  frequently that is not used by the firm in its product descriptions, the need  to include this term in online content can be seen in search logs.  If consumers take a long, “torturous” route  to information frequently accessed, it may be appropriate to redesign the menu  structure and/or insert hyperlinks in “intermediate” pages that are found in  many users’ routes. </p>
    <p><em>Scanner data</em>.  Many consumers are members of supermarket  “clubs.”  In return for signing p for a card  and presenting this when making purchases, consumers are often eligible for  considerable discounts on selected products.</p>
    <p>Researchers use a more  elaborate version of this type of program in some communities.  Here, a number of consumers receive small payments  and/or other incentives to sign up to be part of a research panel.  They then receive a card that they are asked  to present any time they go shopping.   Nearly all retailers in the area usually cooperate.  It is now possible to track what the consumer  bought in all stores and to have a historical record.</p>
    <p>The consumer’s shopping  record is usually combined with demographic information (e.g., income,  educational level of adults in the household, occupations of adults, ages of  children, and whether the family owns and rents) and the family’s television  watching habits.  (Electronic equipment  run by firms such as A. C. Nielsen will actually recognize the face of each  family member when he or she sits down to watch).</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/cb/ScannerData.png" alt="chart" width="500" height="337" /></p>
    <p>It is now possible to assess  the relative impact of a number of factors on the consumer’s choice—e.g.,</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>What brand in a given product category was bought       during the last, or a series of past, purchase occasions;</li>
      <li>Whether, and if so, how many times a consumer has       seen an ad for the brand in question or a competing one;</li>
      <li>Whether the target brand (and/or a competing one)       is on sale during the store visit;</li>
      <li>Whether any brand had preferential display space;</li>
      <li>The impact of income and/or family size on       purchase patterns; and</li>
      <li>Whether a coupon was used for the purchase and,       if so, its value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A “split cable” technology  allows the researchers to randomly select half the panel members in a given  community to receive one advertising treatment and the other half another.  The selection is truly random since each  household, as opposed to neighborhood, is selected to get one treatment or the  other.  Thus, observed differences  should, allowing for sampling error, the be result of advertising exposure  since there are no other systematic differences between groups.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, it has been  found that consumers tend to be more influenced by commercials that they “zap”  through while channel surfing even if they only see part of the  commercial.  This most likely results  from the reality that one must pay greater attention while channel surfing than  when watching a commercial in order to determine which program is worth  watching.</p>
    <p><strong>Scanner data is, at the present time, only available  for certain grocery item product categories</strong>—e.g., food items, beverages, cleaning items, laundry detergent, paper  towels, and toilet paper.  <strong>It is <em>not</em> available for most non-grocery product items</strong>.  Scanner data analysis is most useful for  frequently purchased items (e.g., drinks, food items, snacks, and toilet paper)  since a series of purchases in the same product category yield more information  with greater precision than would a record of one purchase at one point in  time.  Even if scanner data were  available for electronic products such as printers, computers, and MP3 players,  for example, these products would be purchased quite infrequently.  A single purchase, then, would not be as  effective in effectively distinguishing the effects of different factors—e.g.,  advertising, shelf space, pricing of the product and competitors, and availability  of a coupon—since we have <em>at most</em> one  purchase instance during a long period of time during which several of these  factors would apply at the same time.  In  the case of items that are purchased frequently, the consumer has the  opportunity to buy a product, buy a competing product, or buy nothing at all  depending on the status of the brand of interest and competing brands.  In the case of the purchase of an MP3 player,  in contrast, there may be promotions associated with several brands going on at  the same time, and each may advertise.   It may also be that the purchase was motivated by the breakdown of an  existing product or dissatisfaction or a desire to add more capabilities.</p>
    <p><em>Physiological measures</em> are occasionally used to examine consumer  response.  For example, advertisers may  want to measure a consumer’s level of arousal during various parts of an  advertisement.  This can be used to  assess possible discomfort on the negative side and level of attention on the  positive side.</p>
    <p>By attaching a tiny camera to  plain eye glasses worn by the subject while watching an advertisement, it is  possible to determine where on screen or other ad display the subject focuses  at any one time.  If the focus remains  fixed throughout an ad sequence where the interesting and active part area  changes, we can track whether the respondent is following the sequence  intended.  If he or she is not, he or she  is likely either not to be paying as much attention as desired or to be  confused by an overly complex sequence.   In situations where the subject’s eyes do move, we can assess whether  this movement is going in the intended direction.</p>
    <p>Mind-reading would clearly  not be ethical and is, at the present time, not possible in any event.  However, it is possible to measure brain  waves by attaching electrodes.  These  readings will not reveal what the subject actually thinks, but it is possible  to distinguish between <em>beta</em> waves—indicating active thought and analysis—and <em>alpha waves</em>, indicating lower levels of attention.</p>
    <p>An important feature of  physiological measures is that we can often track performance over time.  A subject may, for example, be demonstrating  good characteristics—such as appropriate level of arousal and eye  movement—during some of the ad sequence and not during other parts.  This, then, gives some guidance as to which  parts of the ad are effective and which ones need to be reworked.</p>
    <p>In a variation of direct  physiological measures, a subject may be asked, at various points during an  advertisement, to indicate his or her level of interest, liking, comfort, and  approval by moving a lever or some instrument (much like one would adjust the  volume on a radio or MP3 player).   Republican strategist used this technique during the impeachment and  trial of Bill Clinton in the late 1990s.   By watching approval during various phases of a speech by the former  President, it was found that viewers tended to respond negatively when he  referred to “speaking truthfully” but favorably when the President referred to  the issues in controversy as part of his “private life.”  The Republican researchers were able to  separate average results from Democrats, Independents, and Republicans,  effectively looking at different segments to make sure that differences between  each did not cancel out effects of the different segments.  (For example, if at one point Democrats  reacted positively and Republicans responded negatively with the same  intensity, the average result of apparent indifference would have been very  misleading).</p>
    <p><strong>Research sequence</strong>.  In general, if more than one  type of research is to be used, the more flexible and less precise method—such  as focus groups and/or individual interviews—should generally be used before  the less flexible but more precise methods (e.g., surveys and scanner data) are  used.  Focus groups and interviews are  flexible and allow the researcher to follow up on interesting issues raised by  participants who can be probed.  However,  because the sample sizes are small and because participants in a focus group  are influenced by each other, few data points are collected.  If we run five focus groups with eight people  each, for example, we would have a total of forty responses.  Even if we assume that these are independent,  a sample size of forty would give very imprecise results.  We might conclude, for example, that  somewhere between 5% and 40% of the target market would be interested in the  product we have to offer.  This is  usually no more precise than what we already reasonably new.  Questionnaires, in contrast, are highly inflexible.  It is not possible to ask follow-up  questions.  Therefore, we can use our  insights from focus groups and interviews to develop questionnaires that  contain specific questions that can be asked to a larger number of people.  There will still be some sampling error, but  with a sample size of 1,000+ responses, we may be able to narrow the 95%  confidence interval for the percentage of the target market that is seriously  interested in our product to, say, 17-21%, a range that is much more  meaningful.</p>
    <p><strong>Cautions.</strong>  Some cautions should be heeded in marketing  research.  First, in general, research  should only be commissioned when it is worth the cost.  Thus, research should normally be useful in  making specific decisions (what size should the product be?  Should the product be launched?  Should we charge $1.75 or $2.25?)</p>
    <p>Secondly, marketing research can be,  and often is, abused.  Managers  frequently have their own “agendas” (e.g., they either would like a product to  be launched or would prefer that it <em>not</em> be launched so that the firm will have more resources left over to tackle <em>their </em>favorite products).  Often, a way to get your way is to  demonstrate through “objective” research that your opinions make economic  sense. One example of misleading research, which was reported nationwide in the  media, involved the case of “The Pentagon Declares War on Rush Limbaugh.”  The Pentagon, within a year of the election  of Democrat Bill Clinton, reported that only 4.2% of soldiers listening to the  Armed Forces Network wanted to hear Rush Limbaugh.  However, although this finding was reported  without question in the media, it was later found that the conclusion was based  on the question “What single thing can we do to improve programming?”  If you did not write in something like “Carry  Rush Limbaugh,” you were counted as <em>not </em>wanting  to hear him.</p>

        <p>Das Gebäudereiniger-Handwerk ist ein modernes und innovatives Dienstleistungshandwerk. Nach seiner Anerkennung als Vollhandwerk im Jahr 1934 hat sich das Gebäudereiniger-Handwerk zu einem leistungsstarken Wirtschaftsbereich entwickelt. Seit der Novellierung der Handwerksordnung im Jahr 2004 ist das Gebäudereiniger-Handwerk nunmehr ein Gewerk nach der Anlage B1 der Handwerksordnung.</p>
        <p> Damit ist gleichzeitig der Meisterzwang im Gebäudereiniger-Handwerk entfallen. Direkte Folge war eine Zunahme der Anzahl der Betriebe von 2.087 auf zuletzt 25.779 am Stichtag 30.06.2007.

          Das Spektrum der im Gebäudereiniger-Handwerk angebotenen Dienstleistungen umfasst neben der klassischen Gebäudereinigung sämtliche Service- und Dienstleistungen in und an Gebäuden. So gehören Catering-Services, Hol- und Bringedienste, Hausmeister-Dienste, Parkraumbewachung, Kantinenbewirtschaftung oder die Grünflächenpflege und Winterdienst bereits zu den Standardangeboten vieler progressiver Unternehmen des Gebäudereiniger-Handwerks.</p>
        <p> Mit seinen rund 800.000 Beschäftigten, das sind 2 Prozent aller Beschäftigten in Deutschland, ist das Gebäudereiniger-Handwerk das beschäftigungsstärkste Handwerk in Deutschland. Leistungsstarke, qualitätsorientierte Betriebe, die Bereitschaft und Fähigkeit, die Herausforderungen des Marktes zu erkennen und unternehmerisch zu bewerten, und nicht zuletzt eine gezielte Diversifizierung der Leistungsangebote haben das Gebäudereiniger-Handwerk zu einem modernen Dienstleistungshandwerk, einem wichtigen Wirtschaftsfaktor und zu einem interessanten und sicheren Arbeitgeber gemacht. Arbeitslosigkeit und Lehrstellenmangel sind in diesem Handwerk auch in wirtschaftlich und politisch schwierigen Zeiten weiterhin Fremdwörter! </p>

Home Economics - Domestic Science (2093-2218)
 
Home economics covers both the influence of science and technology on women's
work in the home (particularly the introduction of "labor-saving devices") and
the development of the discipline of Home Economics (known alternatively as
Domestic Science, Family Resources, Consumer Sciences, and other names). The
home economics movement attempted to apply scientific principles and
discoveries to domestic labor. Because the home economics movement shares some
roots with the ecology movement, additional relevant works may be found in the
section NATURAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND LIFE SCIENCES. Some material on nutrition is
cited in the CHEMISTRY section.
 
This section is divided into three subsections:
     Reference (2093-2095)
     General (2096-2194)
     Biographies and Studies of Individuals (2195-2218)

<p>The 6+1 Trait® Writing Model of Instruction &amp; Assessment provides a common language for teachers and students to communicate about the characteristics of writing and establishes a clear vision of what good writing looks like. </p>
<p><img src="/files01/images/traits-logo.png" alt="6+1 Trait Writing Logo" class="right" /></p>
<p>Pioneered by Education Northwest more than 20 years ago, the 6+1 Traits continue to help thousands of teachers worldwide who have been trained in the model improve their writing instruction, their understanding of the qualities of good writing, and their ability to provide effective feedback to students.</p>

             of books and journals in Home Economics and related disciplines.
            Titles published 
          between 1850 and 1950 were selected and ranked by teams of scholars
             for their great historical importance. The first phase of this project
            focused on books published between 1850 and 1925 and a small number
            of journals. Future phases of the project will include books published
            between 1926 and 1950, as well as additional journals. The full text
            of these materials, as well as bibliographies and essays on
            the wide
            array
            of
             subjects relating to Home Economics, are all freely accessible on
            this 
          site. This is the first time a collection of this scale and scope has

Groenekennis wordt dagelijks bijgewerkt en bevat ongeveer 500.000 bronnen.</p>  	<p>  		Groenekennis is de globale view over diverse deelbestanden. Groenekennis is gevuld met alle informatie uit Groen Kennisnet, de Hydrotheek, Tuinpad, IB archief, ARTIK, bioKennis, Kennisbank Plantaardige bronnen, Kennisbank Zeldzame landbouwhuisdieren en afgesloten documentatiebestanden zoals Land Bodem Water en Consumenten- en huishoudstudies.</p>  	<p>  		<a href="http://www.groenkennisnet.nl">Groen Kennisnet</a> is een zeer belangrijk onderdeel van Groenekennis. De doelstelling van Groen Kennisnet is kennis delen op het gebied van Voedsel en Groen te bevorderen en te faciliteren voor een breed publiek.</p>  	<p>  		Bronnen in Groenekennis kunnen direct opgevraagd worden via een geavanceerde zoekmachine met een &#39;google-achtige&#39; interface. Met filters kan ingezoomd worden op diverse aspecten, zoals Trefwoord, Collectie, Jaar en Auteur. Bovendien biedt Groenekennis gebruikers de mogelijkheid om via de E-mail geattendeerd te worden op aanvullingen in specifieke vakgebieden.<br />  		De Tijdschriftenlijst biedt een overzicht van tijdschriften waaruit de artikelen voor Groenekennis worden geselecteerd. Door te klikken op een titel krijgt u alle artikelen uit dat tijdschrift in de Groenekennis database getoond.<br />  		Zoeken op kaart biedt een geografische ingang op de beschikbare publicaties over de binnen dit bestand onderscheiden gebieden.</p>  	<p>  		Groenekennis is onderdeel van het bibliotheeksysteem van Wageningen UR. Praktijkgerichte publicaties en rapporten van Wageningen UR komen daardoor automatisch beschikbaar. Daarnaast wordt de database doorlopend gevuld met voor het groen onderwijs bruikbare bronnen en artikelen, video&rsquo;s en websites. Het percentage online is de laatste jaren gegroeid tot tweederde van de totale aanwas per jaar. Dit percentage groeit nog steeds.</p>  </div></div></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2050596"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>De grootste Nederlandse C2C (consumer to consumer) website (marktplaats.nl) heeft dagelijks 1,3 miljoen bezoekers, de grootste B2C (business to consumer) website (bol.com) heeft 500 duizend bezoekers. In de wetenschappelijke literatuur is er sinds het internettijdperk onderzoek gedaan naar het gebruik van C2C en B2C websites, alleen zijn deze twee soorten websites nog niet in de wetenschappelijke literatuur met elkaar vergeleken in gebruik. Onderzoek naar het verschil in gebruik van C2C en B2C verschaft niet alleen de bedrijven achter deze websites veel nuttige marketing en strategische informatie maar ook de consumentenwetenschap. In deze bachelor scriptie is onderzocht wat het verschil in hedonische en utilitaire motivaties en demografische eigenschappen tussen gebruikers van C2C en B2C websites zijn.</p></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2050478"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>‘Brand experience’ kan een effectieve methode zijn om consumenten over te halen om te kiezen voor duurzame producten. ‘Brand experience’ bestaat uit vijf dimensies, namelijk de zintuiglijke, emotionele, gedragsmatige, intellectuele en de sociale dimensie. Met behulp van de literatuur is gekeken hoe elke dimensie voor duurzame producten kan worden versterkt. Vervolgens is door middel van een experiment getoetst hoe consumenten de verschillende dimensies van 'brand experience' beoordelen. Er is gekeken naar de invloed die de dimensies op de waargenomen duurzaamheid van een product hebben en naar de invloed die zij hebben op de voorkeur voor een product. Daarnaast is gekeken in welke mate persoonlijke verschillen tussen consumenten een bijdrage leveren aan de manier waarop deze consument duurzaamheid beoordeelt. Er werd gekeken of prosociale waardes een invloed hadden op de voorkeur van een consument voor een duurzaam product.</p></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2048450"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>In opdracht van de Ministeries van Infrastructuur en Milieu en van Economische Zaken, gecoördineerd door het Voedingscentrum en onder begeleiding van Milieu Centraal, Rijkswaterstaat Leefomgeving en Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre is met dit onderzoek omvang en samenstelling van de voedselverliezen bij huishoudens in Nederland voor de tweede keer gedetailleerd in kaart gebracht. Het gaat om een herhaling van de meting die in 2010 is uitgevoerd, met dit verschil dat het alleen voedselverliezen betreft die zich via het huishoudelijk afval (rest- en GFT-afval) voordoen. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd in het kader van landelijk beleid dat wordt ingezet om voedselverliezen terug te dringen. Doel is na te gaan welke ontwikkelingen inmiddels zijn waar te nemen. Om de omvang en samenstelling van voedselverlies via huishoudelijk afval te bepalen, is gebruik gemaakt van fysieke metingen van voedsel in restafval en GFT-afval. Hiertoe zijn van deze afvalstromen sorteeranalyses gedaan, waarbij voor representatieve monstername dezelfde methode is gehanteerd als die waarmee in opdracht van de Rijksoverheid de samenstelling van restafval van Nederland wordt bepaald. Ook is de monstername gelijk gehouden aan die van 2010.</p></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2048134"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>Het aanbod van streekeigen producten neemt de laatste jaren toe door de opkomst van de belevingseconomie. Herkomst, gezondheid, kwaliteit, duurzaamheid en authenticiteit zijn tegenwoordig belangrijke thema’s voor de consument. De productie van streekeigen producten is vooralsnog echter veelal aanbod-gestuurd, weinig onderzoek is gedaan in Nederland naar de motieven van consumenten om streekeigen producten te kopen of niet te kopen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is dan ook het achterhalen van de factoren die voor de consument van belang zijn voor het al dan niet kopen van streekeigen producten. Deze inzichten kunnen gebruikt worden om te komen tot het vraag-gericht produceren van streekeigen producten.</p></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2046227"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>De consumenten coöperatie CC2 van o.a. Buys &amp; Ko uit Wageningen is een actieve groep consumenten die zich verenigd hebben om consumenten meer stem te geven in het aanbod van duurzaam voedsel in de regio. Een consumenten coöperatie is een nieuwe interactieve manier om consumenten en hun voedselaanbod meer op elkaar af te stemmen. Het bestuur van CC2 wil inzetten op ondersteuning van de regionale ketens, professionalisering van regionale productie en het mede-onderzoeken van een nieuw winkelconcept voor Buys &amp; Ko. Op verzoek van CC2 is een onderzoek uitgevoerd naar consumentenwensen ten aanzien van deze thema’s in het segment duurzaam voedsel. Doel van het onderzoek is op basis van de voorkeuren van leden en potentiële leden van de consumentenvereniging gericht beleid te formuleren voor het aanbod van duurzaam voedsel in de regio de mogelijke rol daarbij van natuurvoedingswinkel Buys &amp; Ko. Het onderzoek draagt zodoende direct bij aan het vergroten van invloed van de consument op het regionale voedselaanbod.</p></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2045500"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>Previous studies have indicated that consumers are increasingly interested in food-related health risks. E-numbers tend to be avoided by consumers. Further, E-numbers are food-related issue that receives media attention on a regular basis. However, in the scientific literature research concerning the consumers’ attitude specifically towards E-numbers is relatively scarce. Therefore, the present research investigates the avoidance of E-numbers by consumers and attempts to diminish this avoidance. In the research knowledge is proposed as an extension of the SPARTA model and is tested in the different studies. Studies 1 and 2 reveal that consumers have some basic knowledge about E-numbers, such as functions of E-numbers and that it is authorized, but lack knowledge about the natural presence of E-numbers in some food products. Knowledge is found to be a valid extension of the SPARTA model. As a next step, in Study 3 an experiment is performed in which additional information about E-numbers is provided to test whether this significantly increases the level of knowledge and eventually improves the attitude and intention to avoid E-numbers as well. A significant increase in knowledge level was found, but no significant changes in attitude and intention were found. Furthermore, the consumers’ intention to avoid the consumption of food products containing E-numbers was found to be higher than the actual avoidance of these food products. Further research with regard to the effects of providing additional information is advised to further understand the effect. Moreover, intervention on several variables at the same time seems to be needed to eventually diminish the consumers’ avoidance of food products containing E-numbers.</p></div>

Het doel van dit onderzoek is om de motieven en het gedrag van de vervuilers van kantooromgevingen te beschrijven. In dit onderzoek zijn verschillende onderzoeksmethoden toegepast om de onderzoeksvragen mee te beantwoorden. Door middel van literatuuronderzoek zijn factoren beschreven die een rol spelen in het proces van vervuiling en schoonmaak van kantooromgevingen. Vervolgens heeft een focusgroep discussie plaatsgevonden waarmee de standpunten van schoonmakers zijn beschreven. Het literatuuronderzoek en de resultaten die de focusgroep discussie heeft opgeleverd, zijn gebruikt voor de vragenlijsten die voor de interviews zijn gebruikt. De interviews zijn afgenomen bij gebruikers van kantooromgevingen en schoonmaak/facilitair managers. Met de interviews is onderzocht welke gedragingen, attitudes en motieven van toepassing zijn op de vervuilers van kantooromgevingen.</p></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2036450"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>Assessing microbiological quality of perishable products is a difficult process for consumers, since quality is highly dynamical. Expiration dates, prescribed by the government give a static indication of the freshness of a product. Dynamic indicators are proposed to tackle the inaccurateness of these dates, in an attempt to reduce food waste. The aim of this study is to explore how consumers evaluate expiration of perishable products, how this affects their product acceptance, and to what extent real-time indication would influence this acceptance, and thereby reduce food waste.</p></div>

<div class="abstract no_display" id="abstract2035983"><p><strong>Samenvatting:</strong><br>Deze studie onderzocht de invloed van energie-informatie op de verpakking van chips. Hiervoor werd een twee (calorie-informatie: aanwezig versus afwezig) bij twee (beweeginformatie; aanwezig versus afwezig) tussen-proefpersonen-experiment uitgevoerd. Calorie- en beweeginformatie leidde niet tot verschillen in consumptie en sportintentie. Ook een verandering in de werkelijke fysieke activiteit bleef uit. Wel wordt chips met calorie-aanduiding per portie als minder ongezond gezien. Verschillen in schuldgevoel na consumptie zijn niet aangetoond. Opvallend is dat calorieën vrijwel altijd overschat worden, maar dat calorie-informatie deze overschatting reduceert. Overige significante effecten betroffen een hogere beoordeling voor smaak wanneer beweeginformatie aanwezigheid was en een meer verzadigend gevoel tijdens een eetmoment wanneer zowel calorie- als beweeginformatie aanwezig waren.</p></div>

                  <h2>Department Overview</h2>
                  <p>Family and Consumer Studies (FCS) is an interdisciplinary department where faculty and students examine how the social, economic, political, and physical environments affect families, individuals, and consumers. The teaching, research, and service done in the Department focuses on expanding our understanding of how welfare of individuals, and the families in which they live, are affected by external forces and internal forces. As such, the Department Emphasizes applied social science research and teaching with a strong public policy orientation.</p>
                  <p>The FCS Faculty includes individuals trained in business education, demography, education, family economics, gerontology, human development and family studies, psychology, and sociology. This mix of backgrounds has helped the Department to cultivate an inter-disciplinary environment that influences faculty research and faculty services as well as our undergraduate and graduate programs.</p>

                  <p>FCS Prof. Robert Mayer has a new book available now. This book introduces readers to the players and follows the uncertain developmental course of the Consumer Financial Protection Board from the initial vision of Elizabeth Warren through the roller-coaster deliberations of a fractious congress, all the way to final passage. As much as anything, the story is a penetrating case history of the revitalization of citizens’ lobbying.</p>
