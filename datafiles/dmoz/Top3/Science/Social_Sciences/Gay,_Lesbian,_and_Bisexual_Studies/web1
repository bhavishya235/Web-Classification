<h3>Long-range Planning Task Group</h3>
A volunteer Task Group is researching and mapping the constitution, organizational structure, and educational programming of the LAMBDA Educational Consortium, the parent body for the LAMBDA Educational Research Foundation, and the LAMBDA Institute of Gay and Lesbian Studies.  
<p>A goal of Phase I of this project is to complete a feasibility study on the Institute entering into the virtual educational arena, i.e., the development, delivery, evaluation and web conferencing related to online courses.  This event's time budget is 30 working days.  The projected completion date is November 30, 1999.  
<p>Thus, when phase one of this project is completed, we will respond by email to requests for membership with our organization.

<h3>Involvement with LAMBDA</h3>
We acknowledge many requests for information concerning a way that people might contribute to developing LAMBDA's resources.  I direct you to our home page, as ask that you read the section, "Recent Developments and Related Organization News."  Here you will find where we require the most help.
<p>We are a volunteer group of educationalists from mixed disciplines, and at this time do not receive financial compensation.  The LAMBDA Educational Consortium is run on a shoe-string budget, and this aspect will change.  But, it takes time and the continued contributions and efforts by many volunteers to continue our work to meet our organizational goals.  One of our aims is to build this organization into a financially sound and reliant accredited virtual institute of learning.
<p>Nevertheless, our past experience with similar requests, and correspondence on this topic leave us without an outcome, i.e., the person is generally looking for an immediate financial gain.  I am not suggesting this may be the same for everybody.  Yes, we do need and require assistance from academics, researchers, eductionalists, program developers.  However, at this time, we cannot offer any financial compensation for their contributions of time and resources.  
<p>Fees for authored material offered for delivery either by long-distance learning or site learning, assuming registration quotas meet the events budget are negotiated with the author, publisher of pubished material, or with the author of non-published material before the program is marketed or delivered.
<p>What we offer is an invitation to join an innovative educational team, to volunteer time and resources to help construct the blocks to support the organization's aim, but primarily, to assist us with meeting the vision of the LAMBDA Educational Consortium, including research projects that will soon be underway.
<p>If you are or remain interested after reading this posting, please contact us by email.  Then we will begin a dialogue.  If you find what we offer is not what you are looking for, we thank you for your interest.

<H3>A HISTORICAL LOOK</H3>
The following is from an article published in the <B>Perceptions</B> magazine, out of Saskatoon, SK, February 1994, after we received our Certificate of Incorporation, January 10, 1994:<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>What Difference Should It Make?</B><BR>
Sexual orientation should not make any difference!  Two people, with this value in mind, began in April 1993 formulating a plan of action. This resulted in the development of a new nonprofit organization based in Edmonton, called 'LAMBDA Educational Research Foundation'.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Over many cups of coffee, ideas were tossed around and discussed about what the primary purpose of the
Foundation should be. Then it was decided to incorporate as a nonprofit society. With this decision the coffee mates moved on to brainstorming ideas until their heads ached. After several pain killers, we came up with a <B>Mission Statement</B> which reads <I>"The Foundation promotes research into Gay and Lesbian issues and lifestyles for the purpose of public education."</I> <BR>From that moment, we began the long and strenuous search for people who shared this ideal.  We were successful in finding people with different experiences and sexual orientations to join us in being Founders of LAMBDA.  
<P>
LAMBDA was developed on the principle that sexual orientation does not matter.  We were successful at gaining good representation of members no matter their sexual preference.  Needless to say, the focus of the discussions was on aspects of research, education, and the person's views on Gay and Lesbian lifestyles and social issues.
<P>
The Founding members are professional educators, continually researching and developing materials for workshops, seminars, and discussions about Gay and Lesbian issues.  For example, a series of workshops on Relationship Enhancement, Anti-Homophobia seminar for heterosexuals, and Life Skills Student sessions is being worked on, and will be available for registration in the near future.  These sessions are being developed with the idea that public education can be a key element towards creating awareness and growth toward equality.
<P>
Our work is only beginning since we just received our Certificate of Incorporation, and more exciting ideas, developments, and activities are yet to come.  We are excited about the response and support we have received to date!  Therefore! we encourage and welcome folks that share a similar ideal, to drop us a line and/or follow the program of events calendar that will be published in <B>Perceptions</B> this year.

<H3>OVERVIEW of the Foundation and the Institute of Gay and Lesbian Studies</H3>
The LAMBDA Educational Research <B>Foundation</B> was established as a non-profit and autonomous organization in 1994.  <BR>The LAMBDA <B>Institute</B> of Gay and Lesbian Studies was formed as a branch society in 1995 to administer to and carry out the research, education, and consulting components of the society.  The LAMBDA organization is a locally based research and education centre for educators, scholars,  specialists, students, and other interested persons concerned with gay and lesbian social issues, particularly, the multi-faceted issues of the homosexual culture and lifestyle, problems with stability and security, political and social changes.
<P>The Foundation and Institute are governed by a six-member Board of Directors comprising members from various professional backgrounds, including adult education.  A three-person Executive Committee oversees the day-to-day operations; it is chaired by the chief executive officer who along with the Vice Chair and Past Chair povide guidance and leadership to the governing Board.  Five standing committees aid in developing and maintaining of professionalism, membership, education, research, resources, marketing and public relations, organization policy and administration.

<H3>SERVICES</H3>
We have recategorized the organization's service areas since the development of the Institute. 
<BR>The Foundation is responsible for governing the Institute; it will focus on funding, financial matters and other services.  <BR>The Institute will not be solely responsible for this area, but as an educational service provider, it would contribute toward the financial goals of the organization.  The division of responsibilities allows the Foundation to focus on, administer to, and coordinate fundraising activities, membership drives and solicit contributions, and make donations to organizations whose mission statements promote education and research.
<P>
The Institute will concentrate on these services:<UL>
<li><B>Adult, and pre-adult programs</B>.  Such programs include certificate and non-certificate courses which the Institute has built on program planning, curriculum development, delivery and evaluation models. As an educational consulting service provider, we offer program planning, curriculum development, delivery and evaluation for in-house programs.  The long-term intention with some of our courses is to seek accreditation from the Department of Education, with credit transfers to post-secondary institutions.
<li><B>Peer support training and certification</B> programs.
<li><B>Life skills training</B> programs for partners, singles and families.  
<li>Instructional programs.  These include workshops and seminars based on educational products developed by the Institute.  As an educational consulting service provider, we offer development of instructional programs for in-house programs.

<li><B>Libraries and archives</B> - resources for internal use and public access.
<li><B>Speaker's Bureau</B>.  This would include guest presentations, lectures at and for local colleges and universities, secondary schools, health and community service organizations, public educational forums, and professional groups.
<li><B>Oratorical programs</B>.  These include certificate courses designed for skill development in communication and public speaking.  Upon completion, the graduate's name will be added to our accredited speaker's list.  The Institute matches client's requests to a speaker's area of expertise before arranging a speaking engagement.
<li><B>Parliamentary procedure</B> programs.  These include certificate courses, which we offer as a consulting service.
<li><B>Board development </B>programs. These include certificate courses, which we offer as a consulting service.
<li><B>Groups for learning</B> conversations, talk, research and projects with a specific focus and theme.
<li><B>Literary and debating sessions</B>.  These include organized sessions based on themes, with education and skill development as the purpose.  The Institute will offer certificate courses in debate and debating.

</UL>
<B>An important note:</B> As an educational consulting service provider, our services are not limited to the City of Edmonton or the greater Edmonton area.  We possess network capabilities via the Internet that allow us to offer a full range of services which include e-mail, net serving, and distribution of research and educational materials.  We also subscribe to organizations and groups with similar interests throughout the world that have file transfer protocol and newsnet services.  We store educational and service information in dBASE files, which are part of our library and archive databanks.
<P>
<B>OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</B>
Our organization is an education consulting service provider.  To aid our pursuit of information sharing, we are developing marketing strategies and advertising materials.

<div id="usrcontent"><p>The undergraduate Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies is administered through the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis and offers a broad interdisciplinary investigation of gender and sexuality as keys to understanding human experience, fully integrating the study of gender and sexuality in its core curriculum, and insistently extending the view beyond U.S. borders. </p>
<p>At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of "male" and "female," as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality shape social roles and identities, in addition to the ways in which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality within a culture. Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges the privileging of some categories (i.e., male or heterosexual) over others, along with the social and political implications of such hierarchies. Our curriculum makes gender and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is often presented as "natural" or "normal" in traditional academic curricula. </p>

In December, 2010, the US Congress repealed <i>Don't Ask, Don't Tell</i>, pending certification by the Pentagon and the President that the military was ready to implement the repeal. 
That certification was officially made in July, and the repeal of DADT became effective on September 20, 2011.

				<p>Affirming Rainbow Research has been established to conduct research on issues individuals face when they experience same-sex attraction. Currently, we are focused on the topic of religion and sexual orientation. Through conducting research on important issues like this, our ultimate goal is to help counselors, psychologists and other mental health professionals better understand the experiences of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and others who experience same-sex attraction. We intend to provide a place for people from across the country to learn about current perspectives and assist in furthering supportive research by <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=631322620494">completing surveys</a> on different topics from time to time.</p>

<h3>NEH Award goes to Sonali Thakkar</h3>

<img width="250" height="167" src="/i/SonaliThakkar-2.jpg" /><p>We are happy to announce that Sonali Thakkar, CSGS Faculty Affiliate, has been awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for University Teachers to support her project âRace, Religion, and Holocaust Memory in the Literature of Postwar European Diasporic Communities.â  Sonali is an Assistant Professor of English Language and Literature who trained as a comparatist and whose work focuses on global Anglophone and postcolonial literatures as well as contemporary transnational culture. She has worked closely with the center for the past few years, serving as part of the faculty group that created the two-quarter core sequence âGender and Sexuality in World Civilizationsâ and as one of the two instructors in the inaugural quarter of this sequence. You can read more about Sonali Thakkar at <a href="http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/thakkar" target="_blank">http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/thakkar</a>.</p>

<h3>Gender and Sexuality Studies is now part of the Core curriculum in the College!</h3>
<p>UChicago students now have the opportunity to learn about the fundamental importance of gender and sexuality as analytic categories <a href="https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/academics/core.shtml"> as part of their general education requirement</a> teaching the introduction to the tools of inquiry used in every discipline. Read more about Gender and Sexuality in World Civilizations <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/features/Core_combines_timeless_courses_and_fresh_ideas/">here</a>.

<h3>Congratulations to Monica Mercado!</h3>
<p><img style="float:right" height="220" width="160" src="/i/mercado.jpg">We are delighted to spread the news that Monica Mercado has been appointed the Director of the The Albert M. Greenfield Digital Center for the History of Women's Education at Bryn Mawr College. Monica, who will complete her PhD in History this spring, has contributed to CSGS in a variety of ways. She is currently the co-coordinator of the Closeted/Out in the Quadrangles Project at the Center, and she has held a CSGS dissertation fellowship as well as serving as a preceptor and frequent teacher of free-standing courses, including â"Sex and Sexualities in Modern US History" and âQueer on the Quads: Uncovering LGBTQ History at the University of Chicago.â

<h3>...and to Emily Swafford!</h3>
<p><img style="float:right" height="220" width="160"  src="/i/swafford.jpg">We are also delighted to pass on the news that, beginning in April, Emily Swafford will be joining the GHI as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to work on her second project, <em>Ambassadors in Pigtails: U.S. Girl Scouts and the Transnational Cold War, 1950-1989</em>.  This project examines the entangled narratives of these two sometimes opposed organizationsâa national military dedicated to defending Americaâs interests and a youth movement that pitched peaceful internationalismâeven while both were simultaneously engaged in producing and reproducing an American "way of life" on foreign soil. Emilyâs first project, her doctoral dissertation in the History Department, also an examination of American-German relations, is titled "Democracyâs Proving Ground: U.S. Military Families in West Germany Between World War II and Vietnam." Emily has been invaluable to CSGS this year, holding a residential fellowship and serving as a teaching intern in the autumn civilization sequence and as a co-teacher for âProblems in the Study of Sexualityâ in winter. We are sorry to lose Emily before the end of the academic year but very happy about her new position!</p>

<h3>Congratulations to Kathy Forde!</h3>

</p>

<p><i>Joan Roughgarden thinks Charles Darwin made a terrible mistake. Not about natural selection&mdash;she&#8217;s no bible-toting creationist&mdash;but about his other great theory of evolution: sexual selection. According to Roughgarden, sexual selection can&#8217;t explain the homosexuality that&#8217;s been documented in over 450 different vertebrate species. This means that same-sex sexuality&mdash;long disparaged as a quirk of human culture&mdash;is a normal, and probably necessary, fact of life. By neglecting all those gay animals, she says, Darwin misunderstood the basic nature of heterosexuality.</i></p>

<p>Male big horn sheep live in what are often called &#8220;homosexual societies.&#8221; They bond through genital licking and anal intercourse, which often ends in ejaculation. If a male sheep chooses to not have gay sex, it becomes a social outcast. Ironically, scientists call such straight-laced males &#8220;effeminate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Giraffes have all-male orgies. So do bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, gray whales, and West Indian manatees. Japanese macaques, on the other hand, are ardent lesbians; the females enthusiastically mount each other. Bonobos, one of our closest primate relatives, are similar, except that their lesbian sexual encounters occur every two hours. Male bonobos engage in &#8220;penis fencing,&#8221; which leads, surprisingly enough, to ejaculation. They also give each other genital massages.
</p>

		<p>As this list of activities suggests, having homosexual sex is the biological equivalent of apple pie: Everybody likes it. At last count, over 450 different vertebrate species could be beheaded in Saudi Arabia. You name it, there&#8217;s a vertebrate out there that does it. Nevertheless, most biologists continue to regard homosexuality as a sexual outlier. According to evolutionary theory, being gay is little more than a maladaptive behavior. </p>

<p>Joan Roughgarden, a professor of biology at Stanford University, wants to change that perception. After cataloging the wealth of homosexual behavior in the animal kingdom two years ago in her controversial book <I>Evolution&#8217;s Rainbow</I>&mdash;and weathering critiques that, she says, stemmed largely from her being transgendered&mdash;Roughgarden has set about replacing Darwinian sexual selection with a new explanation of sex. For too long, she says, biology has neglected evidence that mating isn&#8217;t only about multiplying. Sometimes, as in the case of all those gay sheep, dolphins and primates, animals have sex just for fun or to cement their social bonds. Homosexuality, Roughgarden says, is an essential part of biology, and can no longer be dismissed. By using the queer to untangle the straight, Roughgarden&#8217;s theories have the potential to usher in a scientific sexual revolution. </p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s theory of sex began with an observation about peacocks. For a man who liked to see the world in terms of functional adaptations, the tails of male peacocks seemed like a useless absurdity. Why would nature invest in such a baroque display of feathers? Did male peacocks <I>want</I> to be eaten by predators? </p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s hypothesis was typically brilliant: The peacocks did it for the sake of reproduction. The male&#8217;s fancy tail entranced the staid peahen. Darwin used this idea to explain the biological quirks that natural selection couldn&#8217;t explain. If a trait wasn&#8217;t in the service of survival, then it was probably in the service of seduction. Furthermore, the mechanics of sex helped explain why the genders were so different. Because eggs are expensive and sperm are cheap, &#8220;Males of almost all animals have stronger passions than females,&#8221; Darwin wrote. &#8220;The female&#8230;with the rarest of exceptions is less eager than the male&#8230;she is coy.&#8221; Darwin is telling the familiar Mars and Venus story: Men want sex while women want to cuddle. Females, by choosing who to bed, impose sexual selection onto the species.</p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s theory of sex has been biological dogma ever since he postulated why peacocks flirt. His gendered view of life has become a centerpiece of evolution, one of his great scientific legacies. The culture wars over evolution and common descent notwithstanding, Darwin&#8217;s theory of sexual selection has been thoroughly assimilated into mass culture. From sitcoms to beer ads, our coital &#8220;instincts&#8221; are constantly reaffirmed. Females are wary, and males are horny. Sex is this simple. Or is it?</p>

<p>Indeed, biology now knows better. Nobody is hornier than a female macaque or bonobo (which mount the males because the males are too exhausted to continue the fornication). Peacocks are actually the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p>Roughgarden first began thinking Darwin may have been in error after she attended the 1997 gay pride parade in San Francisco, where she had gone to walk alongside a float in support of transgendered people. Although she had lived her first 52 years as a man, Roughgarden was about to become a woman. The decision hadn&#8217;t been easy. For one thing, she was worried about losing her job as a tenured professor of biology at Stanford. (The fear turned out to be unfounded.)</p>

<p>After living for a year in Santa Barbara while undergoing the &#8220;physical aspects of the transition,&#8221; Roughgarden returned to Stanford in the spring of 1999 and decided to write a book about the biology of sexual diversity. In particular, she wanted to answer the question that had first surfaced in her mind back in 1997. &#8220;When I was at that gay pride parade,&#8221; Roughgarden remembers, &#8220;I was just stunned by the sheer magnitude of the LGBT [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender] population. Because I&#8217;m a biologist, I started asking myself some difficult questions. My discipline teaches that homosexuality is some sort of anomaly. But if the purpose of sexual contact is just reproduction, as Darwin believed, then why do all these gay people exist? A lot of biologists assume that they are somehow defective, that some developmental error or environmental influence has misdirected their sexual orientation. If so, gay and lesbian people are a mistake that should have been corrected a long time ago. But this hasn&#8217;t happened. That&#8217;s when I had my epiphany. When scientific theory says something&#8217;s wrong with so many people, perhaps the theory is wrong, not the people.&#8221;</p>

</p>

<p>The resulting book, <I>Evolution&#8217;s Rainbow</I>, was an audacious attack on Darwin&#8217;s theory of sexual selection. To make her case, Roughgarden filled the text with a staggering collection of animal perversities, from the penises of female spotted hyenas to the m&egrave;nage &agrave; trois tactics of bluegill sunfish. As Roughgarden put it, &#8220;What&#8217;s coming out [in the past 10-15 years] is to the rest of the species what the Kinsey Report was to humans.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Roughgarden, classic sexual selection can&#8217;t account for these strange carnal habits. After all, Darwin imagined sex as a relatively straightforward transaction. Males compete for females. Evolutionary success is defined by the quantity of offspring. Thus, any distractions from the business of making babies&mdash;distractions like homosexuality, masturbation, etc.&mdash;are precious wastes of fluids. You&#8217;d think by now, several hundred million years after sex began, nature would have done away with such inefficiencies, and males and females would only act to maximize rates of sexual reproduction.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But the opposite has happened. Instead of copulation becoming more functional and straightforward, it has only gotten weirder as species have evolved&mdash;more sodomy and other frivolous pleasures that are useless for propagating the species. The more socially complex the animal, the more sexual &#8220;deviance&#8221; it exhibits. Look at primates: Compared to our closest relatives, contemporary, Westernized <I>Homo sapiens</I> are the staid ones. </p>

<p>Despite this new evidence, sexual selection theory is still stuck in the 19th century. The Victorian peacock remains the standard bearer. But as far as Roughgarden is concerned, that&#8217;s bad science: &#8220;The time has come to declare that sexual theory is indeed false and to stop shoe-horning one exception after another into a sexual selection framework&#8230;To do otherwise suggests that sexual selection theory is unfalsifiable, not subject to refutation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roughgarden is an ambitious scientist. She believes it is impossible to comprehend the diversity of sexuality without disowning Darwin. Although she isn&#8217;t the first biologist to condemn sexual selection&mdash;Darwin&#8217;s theory has never been very popular with feminists&mdash;she is unusually vocal about cataloguing his empirical errors. &#8220;When I began, I didn&#8217;t set out to criticize Darwin,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But I quickly realized that most scientists are pretty dismissive about same-sex sexuality in vertebrates. They think these animals are just having fun or practicing. As long as scientists clung to this old dogma, homosexuality would always be this funny anomaly you didn&#8217;t have to account for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roughgarden&#8217;s first order of business was proving that homosexuality isn&#8217;t a maladaptive trait. At first glance, this seems like a futile endeavor. Being gay clearly makes individuals less likely to pass on their genes, a major biological faux pas. From the perspective of evolution, homosexual behavior has always been a genetic dead end, something that has to be explained away.</p>

<p>But Roughgarden believes that biologists have it backwards. Given the pervasive presence of homosexuality throughout the animal kingdom, same-sex partnering must be an adaptive trait that&#8217;s been carefully preserved by natural selection. As Roughgarden points out, &#8220;a &#8216;common genetic disease&#8217; is a contradiction in terms, and homosexuality is three to four orders of magnitude more common than true genetic diseases such as Huntington&#8217;s disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>So how might homosexuality be good for us? Any concept of sexual selection that emphasizes the selfish propagation of genes and sperm won&#8217;t be able to account for the abundance of non-heterosexual sex. All those gay penguins and persons will remain inexplicable. However, if one looks at homosexuality from the perspective of a community, one can begin to see why nature might foster a variety of sexual interactions.</p>

<p>According to Roughgarden, gayness is a necessary side effect of getting along. Homosexuality evolved in tandem with vertebrate societies, in which a motley group of individuals has to either live together or die alone. In fact, Roughgarden even argues that homosexuality is a defining feature of advanced animal communities, which require communal bonds in order to function. &#8220;The more complex and sophisticated a social system is,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;the more likely it is to have homosexuality intermixed with heterosexuality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Japanese macaques, an old world primate, illustrate this principle perfectly. Macaque society revolves around females, who form intricate dominance hierarchies within a given group. Males are transient. To help maintain the necessary social networks, female macaques engage in rampant lesbianism. These friendly copulations, which can last up to four days, form the bedrock of macaque society, preventing unnecessary violence and aggression. Females that sleep together will even defend each other from the unwanted advances of male macaques. In fact, behavioral scientist Paul Vasey has found that females will choose to mate with another female, as opposed to a horny male, 92.5% of the time. While this lesbianism probably decreases reproductive success for macaques in the short term, in the long run it is clearly beneficial for the species, since it fosters social stability. &#8220;Same-sex sexuality is just another way of maintaining physical intimacy,&#8221; Roughgarden says. &#8220;It&#8217;s like grooming, except we have lots of pleasure neurons in our genitals. When animals exhibit homosexual behavior, they are just using their genitals for a socially significant purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roughgarden is now using this model of homosexuality to reimagine heterosexuality. Her conclusions, published last February in <I>Science</I>, are predictably controversial. While Darwin saw males and females as locked in conflict, acting out the ancient battle of their gametes, Roughgarden describes sexual partners as a model of solidarity. &#8220;This whole view of the sexes as being at war is just so flawed from the start. First of all, there are all these empirical exceptions, like homosexuality. And then there&#8217;s the logical inconsistency of it all. Why would a male ever jettison control of his evolutionary destiny? Why would he entrust females to serendipitously raise their shared young? The fact is, males and females are committed to cooperate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Consider the Eurasian oystercatcher, a shore bird that enjoys feasting on shellfish. A consistent minority of oystercatcher families are polygynous, in which a lucky male mates with two different females simultaneously. These threesomes come in two different flavors: aggressive and cooperative. In an aggressive threesome, the females are at war; they attack each other frequently, and try to disrupt the egg-laying process of their fellow spouse. So far, so Darwinian: Life is nasty, brutish and short. However, the cooperative threesome is everything Darwin didn&#8217;t expect. These females share a nest, mate with each other several times a day, and preen their feathers together. It&#8217;s domestic bliss.</p>

<p class="insetImage narrow">

</p>

<p>In Roughgarden&#8217;s Science paper, she uses &#8220;cooperative game theory&#8221; to elucidate the diverse mating habits of the oystercatcher. Whereas Darwin held that conflict was the natural state of life (we are all Hobbesian bullies at heart), Roughgarden sees cooperation as our default position. This makes mathematical sense: The family that sleeps together has more offspring. Why, then, do oystercatcher females occasionally engage in all out war? According to Roughgarden, violence occurs when &#8220;social negotiations&#8221; break down. Although the birds really want to get along (who doesn&#8217;t like being preened?), something goes awry. The end result is risky violence, in which one female or both will end the breeding season without an egg.</p>

<p>The advantage of Roughgarden&#8217;s new theory is that it can explain a wider spectrum of sexual behaviors than Darwinian sexual selection. Lesbian oystercatchers and gay mountain sheep? Their homosexuality is just a prelude to social cooperation, a pleasurable way of avoiding wanton conflict. But what about the peacock and all those other examples of sexual dimorphism? According to Roughgarden, &#8220;expensive, functionally useless badges like the peacock&#8217;s tail&#8230;are admission tickets&#8221;: they just get you in the door. If you don&#8217;t have a ticket, you are ruthlessly denied breeding rights, like an uncool kid at the prom. </p>

<p>Of course, most humans don&#8217;t see sex as a way of maintaining the social contract. Our lust doesn&#8217;t seem logical, especially when that logic involves the abstruse calculations of game theory. Furthermore, it&#8217;s strange for most people to think of themselves as naturally bisexual. Being gay or straight seems to be an intrinsic and implacable part of our identity. Roughgarden disagrees. &#8220;In our culture, we assume that there is a straight-gay binary, and that you are either one or the other. But if you look at vertebrates, that just isn&#8217;t the case. You will almost never find animals or primates that are exclusively gay. Other human cultures show the same thing.&#8221; Since Roughgarden believes that the hetero/homo distinction is a purely cultural creation, and not a fact of biology, she thinks it is only a matter of time before we return to the standard primate model. &#8220;I&#8217;m convinced that in 50 years, the gay-straight dichotomy will dissolve. I think it just takes too much social energy to preserve. All this campy, flamboyant behavior: It&#8217;s just such hard work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite Roughgarden&#8217;s long list of peer-reviewed articles in prestigious journals, most evolutionary biologists remain skeptical of her conclusions. For one thing, it&#8217;s tough to measure the benefits of diversity&mdash;or lesbian pair bonding. It&#8217;s even harder to imagine how traits that are good for the group get passed on by individuals. (As a result, group selection has largely been replaced by kin selection.) In the absence of anything conclusive, most scientists stick with Darwin and Dawkins.</p>

<p>Other biologists think Roughgarden is exaggerating the importance of homosexuality. Invertebrate zoologist Stephen Shuster told <I>Nature</I> that Roughgarden &#8220;throws out a very healthy baby with some slightly soiled bathwater.&#8221; And biologist Alison Jolly, in an otherwise positive review of <I>Evolution&#8217;s Rainbow</I> for Science, conceded that Roughgarden ultimately fails in her ambition to &#8220;revolutionize current biological theories of sexual selection.&#8221; As far as these mainstream biologists are concerned, Roughgarden&#8217;s gay primates and transgendered fish are simply interesting sexual deviants, statistical outliers in a world that contains plenty of peacocks. As Paul Z. Myers, a biologist at the University of Minnesota, put it, &#8220;I think much of what Roughgarden says is very interesting. But I think she discounts many of the modifications that have been made to sexual selection since Darwin originally proposed it. So in that sense, her Darwin is a straw man. You don&#8217;t have to dismiss the modern version of sexual selection in order to explain social bonding or homosexuality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roughgarden remains defiant. &#8220;I think many scientists discount me because of who I am. They assume that I can&#8217;t be objective, that I&#8217;ve got some bias or hidden LGBT agenda. But I&#8217;m just trying to understand the data. At this point, we have thousands of species that deviate from the standard account of Darwinian sexual selection. So we get all these special case exemptions, and we end up downplaying whatever facts don&#8217;t fit. The theory is becoming Ptolemaic. It clearly has the trajectory of a hypothesis in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roughgarden&#8217;s cataloging of sexual diversity has challenged a fundamental biological theory. If Darwinian sexual selection&mdash;whatever its current variant&mdash;is to survive, it must adapt to this new data and come up with convincing explanations for why a host of animals just aren&#8217;t like peacocks.

<p>Sexual orientation is the idea that everyone is either homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual. Supposedly, everyone fits into one of these boxes. Which box a person's sexual desires fit into is also supposed to tell us what sort of person they 'really' are.</p>

<p>How are we supposed to know what we (and other people) 'really' are? You only have to answer two simple questions: 1) are you a man or a woman? and 2) are you sexually attracted to men, women or both? But, are these questions that simple? Maybe not.</p>

<p>This site is developing as a resource to help people think about sexuality and relationships differently. Is it okay to tell people who they really are, who they should be or what they should want? This is what is happening when we try to fit people into sexual orientation boxes. </p>

<p>At the moment, the site focuses on my PhD research project, which tried to develop an understanding of how people experience 'sexual orientation' and what can be done about the problems it causes. So, some of the things on the site are a bit academic and some aren't. I am working to add more material all the time, both academic and otherwise. If you want to be informed of updates to the site, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</A> to be added to the e-mailing list.<br /><br />

Census 2000 showed us that same-sex couples live in 99 percent of all U.S. counties. They live&mdash;and mostly likely vote&mdash;in nearly every congressional district. Information from Census further allows us to analyze understudied subsets of the gay and lesbian population, such as seniors, couples with children, and racial and ethnic minorities. For instance, 96 percent of all U.S. counties have at least one same-sex couple with children under 18; yet only seven states and the District of Columbia have laws supporting gay and lesbian couple adoption. We observe trends in same-sex families, identify workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, examine economic outlooks for gay and lesbian seniors, and explore the fact that enlisted gay men and lesbians defend this country.</p> <a id="RecentFindings" name="RecentFindings"></a>  <h2>Recent Findings</h2> <p><b>More than 36,000 gay men and lesbians actively serve in the military.</b></p> <p>Even though the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy does not permit lesbians and gay men to serve openly, census data make clear that they are actively serving in the armed forces, in guard and reserve units, and have served in the military throughout the later part of the 20th century. Estimates suggest that gay men and lesbians represent 2.5 percent of active duty personnel. When the guard and reserve are included, nearly 65,000 men and women in uniform are likely gay or lesbian, accounting for 2.8 percent of military personnel.</p> <p>In general, coupled gay men are less likely to report military service than other men, while coupled lesbians are more likely than other women to serve. Service rates in the last decade of the 20th century among coupled lesbians age 18&ndash;27 were more than three times higher than rates among other women.</p> <p><b>For more information:</b></p> <ul> <li>Gates, Gary J. 2004.

Washington, DC: The Urban Institute.</li> </ul> <p><b>Lack of a marriage license may cost tens of thousands of dollars&mdash;and the loss of a home&mdash;when a partner dies.</b></p> <p>In more than one in 10 same-sex couples, one partner is 65 years old or older. Census 2000 shows us that 97 percent of U.S. counties have a senior in a same-sex partnership. The greatest numbers of same-sex senior couples live in California, New York, and Florida. Illinois and Arizona also have significant numbers. Prevalence aside, the aging of the gay, lesbian, and bisexual community is not particularly golden for many. These couples cannot be recognized as legally married, so a surviving partner loses financial ground. Survivors are denied the Social Security benefits that married couples get, face heavy taxes on any retirement plan, and get charged an estate tax if they inherit a home, even if it was jointly owned.</p> <p>Same-sex senior couples are more likely to still be making mortgage payments when one dies. Combined with other financial losses, this higher debt burden puts surviving partners at greater risk of losing their home. Even before a partner's death, these seniors risk losing their home when an elderly partner enters a nursing home. Federal Medicaid law permits a married spouse to remain in the couple's home, but not an unmarried partner.</p> <p><b>For more information:</b></p> <ul> <li>"<a title="Read this item online ..." href="/url.cfm?ID=900627">Gay and Lesbian Families in the Census: Gay and Lesbian Seniors</a>." <i>Checkpoints: data releases on economic and social issues.</i> 2003.

Increasingly, cities are trying to attract gay and lesbian residents to enliven the culture by diversifying it. Cities have also figured out that gay people are often more willing than others to move into and devote income to improving distressed neighborhoods, which attracts other people and sets a cycle of improvement in motion.</p> <p>Diversity enhances innovation and creativity by allowing different perspectives and ideas to be heard. The creative and innovative people driving the tech economy seek places high in cultural and racial/ethnic diversity&ndash;and so do gays and lesbians. It is likely not a coincidence that high-tech centers like metropolitan San Francisco, Washington, Austin, Atlanta, and San Diego also have large and visible gay populations.</p> <p><b>For more information:</b></p> <ul> <li>"<a title="Read this item online ..." href="/url.cfm?ID=900634">The Demographics of Diversity: Why Cities are Courting the Gay and Lesbian Community?</a>" June 3, 2003. <i>First Tuesdays</i> transcript.</li> <li>Florida, Richard, and Gary Gates. 2001.

July 21.</li> </ul> <p><b>How are gay men and lesbians counted in Census 2000?</b></p> <p>Since the U.S. Census Bureau asks no questions about sexual orientation or behavior, how do researchers identify gay men and lesbians? The Census form <i>does</i> ask about relationships between individuals in the household, including husband/wife, son/daughter, brother/sister, and so on. For the first time in 1990, the Census Bureau also added an "unmarried partner" category. If the person filling out the census form designates another adult of the same sex as his or her unmarried partner, the couple is counted as a same-sex unmarried partner household. Research strongly indicates that the same-sex unmarried pair identified by the census are, in fact, gay and lesbian couples.</p> <p>The way data is edited once it's collected changed in Census 2000 too. In 1990, when another adult of the same sex as the householder was identified as a "husband/wife," the couple was counted as a heterosexual married couple. In 2000, the "husband/wife" was counted as an "unmarried partner." Counting these same-sex married couples along with the same-sex unmarried partners helps explain the dramatic upsurge in the same-sex couple counts between 1990 and 2000. An even bigger factor may be the growing willingness of gay men and lesbians to identify themselves as partners.</p> <p>Many gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered individuals never show up in the Census data. The most significant omission is of single gay men and lesbians since, survey data show, only about a quarter of gay men and two-fifths of lesbians are in couples at any given time.</p> <p><b>For more information:</b></p> <ul> <li>Gates, Gary J., and Jason Ost. 2004. <a title="Learn more about this UI Press title ..." href="/pubs/gayatlas/"><i>The Gay and Lesbian Atlas</i></a>.

<p>The <b>demographics of sexual orientation</b> are difficult to establish for a variety of reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical findings regarding <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bisexuality" title="Bisexuality">bisexuality</a> has to do with the nature of the research questions. Major research studies on <a href="/wiki/Sexual_orientation" title="Sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a> are discussed. Most of the studies listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject matter. More importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_attraction" title="Same-sex attraction" class="mw-redirect">attractions</a> while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as <a href="/wiki/LGBT" title="LGBT">gay, lesbian, or bisexual</a>. Fewer research subjects identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual than report having sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Homophobia" title="Homophobia">Homophobic</a> settings may mean that some LGBT people may not openly identify as such, and open identification of one's true sexual orientation may depend on the status of <a href="/wiki/LGBT_rights" title="LGBT rights" class="mw-redirect">LGBT rights</a> in a given location.</p>

<p>Another significant distinction can be made between what medical statisticians call <a href="/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)" title="Incidence (epidemiology)">incidence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prevalence" title="Prevalence">prevalence</a>. For example, even if two studies agree on a common criterion for defining a sexual orientation, one study might regard this as applying to any person who has ever met this criterion, whereas another might only regard them as being so if they had done so during the year of the survey. However, it must be understood that sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes. Sexual orientation also refers to a personâs sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions. Therefore, a person can be celibate and still identify as being bisexual or homosexual based on romantic proclivities.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The population that has come to be referred to as "gay" in the West is not a descriptive term that would be recognized by all <a href="/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men" title="Men who have sex with men">men who have sex with men</a> (MSM) as known in the rest of the world. While gay culture is increasingly open and discussed, the world of MSM consists of a diverse population that often may respond differently depending on how communications in clinical settings are framed. "Gay" is generally used to describe a sexual orientation, while "MSM" describes a behavior.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some men who have sex with other men will not relate to the term "gay" or homosexual, and do not regard sex with other men as sexual activity, a term they reserve for sexual relations with women. This is particularly true among individuals from non-Western cultures. Nevertheless, it is common in the US. Terms such as MSM or âsame gender lovingâ are often used in place of the word gay. Men in Africa and Latin America engage in sexual relationships with other men while still referring to themselves as 'heterosexual', which is known as being on the "<a href="/wiki/Down-low_(sexual_slang)" title="Down-low (sexual slang)">down-low</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The same is true of men who engage in homosexual activities in the military, gender-segregated schools and universities, or prison; most of them do not consider themselves gay but still engage sexually with members of their own sex in order to fulfill their desires.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There is a lack of information on sexual behaviour in most <a href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries" class="mw-redirect">developing countries</a>.

<p>Two of the most famous studies of the demographics of human sexual orientation were Dr. <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey" title="Alfred Kinsey">Alfred Kinsey</a>'s <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> (1948) and <i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</i> (1953). These studies used a <a href="/wiki/Kinsey_scale" title="Kinsey scale">seven-point spectrum</a> to define sexual behavior, from 0 for completely heterosexual to 6 for completely homosexual. Kinsey concluded that a small percentage of the population were to one degree or another bisexual (falling on the scale from 1 to 5). He also reported that 37% of men in the U.S. had achieved <a href="/wiki/Orgasm" title="Orgasm">orgasm</a> through contact with another male after adolescence and 13% of women had achieved orgasm through contact with another woman.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>His results, however, have been disputed, especially in 1954 by a team consisting of <a href="/wiki/John_Tukey" title="John Tukey">John Tukey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Mosteller" title="Frederick Mosteller">Frederick Mosteller</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Gemmell_Cochran" title="William Gemmell Cochran">William G.

<p><a href="/wiki/Paul_Gebhard" title="Paul Gebhard">Paul Gebhard</a>, Kinsey's successor as director of the <a href="/wiki/Kinsey_Institute_for_Sex_Research" title="Kinsey Institute for Sex Research" class="mw-redirect">Kinsey Institute for Sex Research</a>, dedicated years to reviewing the Kinsey data and culling its purported contaminants. In 1979, Gebhard (with Alan B. Johnson) concluded that none of Kinsey's original estimates were significantly affected by the perceived bias, finding that 36.4% of men had engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, as opposed to Kinsey's 37%.</p>

A further 0.5% self-identified as "other", and 3% responded as "do not know" or refused to answer.<sup id="cite_ref-bbc.co.uk_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bbc.co.uk-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> In total this adds up to 5% of people who do not identify as heterosexual, or alternatively 99% who do not identify as either gay or lesbian. Ben Summerskill, chief executive of the gay equality charity Stonewall stated: "This is the first time that people were asked and data collection happened on doorsteps or over the phone, which may deter people from giving accurate responses - particularly if someone isn't openly gay at home." Stonewall worked with 600 major employers and their experience had shown that these statistics increased when people were regularly asked about sexual orientation as part of general monitoring information.</p>

<p>In general, most research agrees that the number of people who have had multiple same-gender sexual experiences is fewer than the number of people who have had a single such experience, and that the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively homosexual is fewer than the number of people who have had multiple homosexual experiences.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="The material near this tag may be based upon unreliable original research.

<p>In addition, major historical shifts can occur in reports of the prevalence of homosexuality. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> Institute for Sexual Research conducted a survey over the sexual behavior of young people in 1970 and repeated it in 1990. Whereas in 1970 18% of the boys ages 16 and 17 reported to have had at least one same-sex sexual experience, the number had dropped to 2% by 1990.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> "Ever since homosexuality became publicly argued to be an innate sexual orientation, boys' fear of being seen as gay has, if anything, increased", the director of the institute, Volkmar Sigusch, suggested in a 1998 article for a German medical journal.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Drawing on information from four recent national and two state-level population-based surveys, the analyses suggest that there are more than 8 million adults in the US who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual, comprising 3.5% of the adult population. Of men, 2.2% identify as gay and an additional 1.4% as bisexual. Of women, 1.1% identify as lesbian and an additional 2.2% as bisexual.</p>

      <P>This summary sheet is not intended to be a comparative analysis or recommendation 
        of the studies referenced. Its purpose is to respond to inquiries received 
        by the Institute by indicating the range of findings in the research literature, 
        beginning with Alfred Kinsey's two studies, often referred to together 
        as the <EM>Kinsey Reports</EM>. 
      <P>Studies often differ sharply in: 1) definitions; 2) methodology; 3) response 
        rates. The majority are based on nonrandom samples. Some look at current/previous 
        year behavior only and others at extended time periods in respondents' 
        lives. They are listed in chronological order.

      <H2><a name="1948kinsey">The 1948 and 1953 Studies of Alfred Kinsey</a></h2>
      <P>Kinsey's samples are best for younger adults, particularly the college-educated; 
        they are poorest for minorities and those from lower socioeconomic and 
        educational levels. The original male sample included institutionalized 
        men. Paul Gebhard <A href="#Gebhard1979">(Gebhard 1979)</A>, a Kinsey 
        research associate and later director of the Institute, described Kinsey's 
        sampling method as &quot;quota sampling accompanied by opportunistic collection&quot; 
        (p. 26). Kinsey's data came from in-depth, face-to-face interviews (with 
        5300 white males and 5940 white females providing almost all of the data).</p>
      <P><em>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</em><A href="#Kinsey1948"> (1948)</A> 
        and <em>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</em> <A href="#Kinsey1953">(1953)</A> 
        reported that: 
      <UL>
        <li>37% of males and 13% of females had at least some overt homosexual 
          experience to orgasm; 
        <li>10% of males were more or less exclusively homosexual and 8% of males 
          were exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages 
          of 16 and 55. For females, Kinsey reported a range of 2-6% for more 
          or less exclusively homosexual experience/response. 
        <li>4% of males and 1-3% of females had been exclusively homosexual after 
          the onset of adolescence up to the time of the interview. 
        <li>Kinsey devised a classification scheme to measure sexual orientation. 
          It is commonly known as <a href="../research/ak-hhscale.html">the Kinsey 
          Scale</a> 
      </UL>
      <H3>Reanalyses of Alfred Kinsey's Data</H3>
      <p>In the <EM>Final Report and Background Papers</EM> of the National Institute 
        of Mental Health's Task Force on Homosexuality <A href="#Gebhard1972">(Gebhard 
        1972)</A>, Gebhard reanalyzed Kinsey's data to eliminate sample bias. 
        His refined figures showed that between one-quarter and one-third of adult 
        white males with college education had had an &quot;overt homosexual experience 
        since puberty&quot; (mostly in the adolescent years); weighting by marital 
        status, he estimated that 4% of the white college-educated males and between 
        1-2% (and closer to 1%) of white females were predominantly or exclusively 
        homosexual.</p>
      <p>In <EM>The Kinsey Data</EM><a href="#Gebhard1979">, Gebhard and Johnson 
        (1979)</a> reexamined the amount of homosexual experience in Kinsey's 
        basic sample of noninstitutionalized males and females. They found 9.9% 
        of the males in the College Sample had extensive homosexual experience. 
        3.7% of females had extensive homosexual experience. 
      <p>Tabulations by Gebhard <A href="#McWhirter1990">(McWhirter 1990)</A> 
        on Kinsey's basic sample of noninstitutionalized males and females indicated 
        that &quot;13.95% of males and 4.25% of females, or a combined average 
        of 9.13%&quot; had had either &quot;extensive&quot; or &quot;more than

        by marital status. 
      <p><A href="#Gagnon1973">John Gagnon and William Simon (1973)</A> also reanalyzed 
        Kinsey's data, focusing on the college sample. In their tabulations, 30% 
        of males reported a homosexual experience to orgasm for the male or his 
        partner; of this group, 25% had the experience(s) as adolescents or had 
        only isolated experiences before the age of 20. The remaining 5-6% broke 
        down evenly, with 3% having had &quot;substantial homosexual histories&quot; 
        and 3% having had &quot;exclusively homosexual histories.&quot; The comparable 
        figure for females having had a homosexual experience was 6%. Of these, 
        4% had experience limited to adolescence or scattered experience before 
        the age of 20, leaving 2% with significant adult homosexual experience, 
        and less than 1% with exclusively homosexual histories.</p>

      <h3><A href="#Hunt1974">Hunt (1974)</A></h3>
      <p>Hunt's survey of sexual behavior in the 1970s indicated that 7% of males 
        and 3% of females had homosexual experiences during more than three years 
        of their lives. In comparing his data to Kinsey's, Hunt adjusted Kinsey's 
        37% figure (for males having had some same-sex contact to orgasm) to 25% 
        and Kinsey's 4% exclusive-homosexuality figure for males to 2-3%. He considered 
        less than 1% of females as &quot;mainly to completely homosexual.&quot; 
        This was a volunteer survey of 2036 people using questionnaires. 
      <h3><A href="#Pietro1977">Pietropinto and Simenauer (1977)</A></h3>
      <p>Pietropinto and Simenauer conducted a large-scale survey of 4066 men 
        in which they asked: &quot;With what type of partner do you usually engage 
        in sex?&quot; 1.3% responded &quot;with men only&quot;; 3.1% responded 
        &quot;men and women.&quot; Field agents used a self-administered written

        National Opinion Research Center (NORC) interviews for males, the authors 
        gave an estimated minimum prevalence of 20.3% of adult males having had 
        a homosexual experience to orgasm, with 3.3% of adult men reporting having 
        had homosexual sex &quot;occasionally&quot; or &quot;fairly often&quot; 
        at some point in their adult lives (at age 20 or later). 
      <h3><A href="#Harry1990">Harry (1990)</A></h3>
      <p>Harry's telephone survey was based on a national probability sample of 
        663 males. The survey included a question about sexual attraction to members 
        of the same sex. In the weighted data, 3.7% gave their orientation as 
        bisexual or homosexual.

        5-6% of adults as homosexual or bisexual since age 18 (with the percentage 
        for exclusive homosexuality as less than 1%). The GSS is a probability 
        sample of approximately 1500 people, and nationally representative; the 
        results are based on a one-page self-administered questionnaire on sexual 
        behavior in the last year and since age 18. [Smith has issued a 1998 report 
        of <EM>American Sexual Behavior: Trends, Socio-Demographic Differences,

      <p>Janus and Janus, in their cross-sectional (not random) nationwide survey 
        of American adults aged 18 and over, stated that 9% of men and 5% of women 
        reported having had homosexual experiences &quot;frequently&quot; or &quot;ongoing.&quot; 
        In another measure, 4% of men and 2% of women self-identified as homosexual. 
        The authors used a questionnaire, supplemented by 125 interviews (4,550 
        questionnaires were distributed, 3,260 were returned, and 2,765 were usable).</p>

      <p>A national survey of 3321 men was conducted in 1991 by Batelle Human 
        Affairs Research Center in Seattle, supported by a grant from the National 
        Institute for Child Health and Human Development, to obtain data on the 
        number of men engaging in sexual behaviors that put them at risk for AIDS. 
        It was a national probability sample of 20-39 year-old noninstitutionalized 
        males. 2% of sexually active men in the survey reported same-gender sexual 
        activity during the last 10 years, with 1% reporting being &quot;exclusively 
        homosexual&quot; during this time (p. 52). Participants were interviewed 
        in person using a standard questionnaire; they also filled out a self-administered 
        questionnaire. 
      <h3><A href="#Taylor1993">Taylor (1993)</A></h3>
      <P>The Harris Poll published a critique of the Batelle 1% figure, comparing 
        it with their own data from a 1988 three-national survey of AIDS' risk 
        behavior conducted for Project Hope's Center for Health Affairs, which 
        found more than 4% of men aged 16-50 and more than 3% of women in the 
        same age group reporting a same-sex sexual partner in the previous five 
        years. 
      <h3><A href="#Laumann1994">Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, and Michaels (1994)</A></h3>
      <P>A research team at the University of Chicago headed a project that conducted 
        interviews in 1992 of a random probability sample of 3,432 men and women 
        in the U.S. between the ages of 18-59 (National Health and Social Life 
        Survey). Homosexuality was viewed as a complex of same-gender behavior, 
        desire, and identity. 9% of men and 4% of women reported having engaged 
        in at least one same-gender sexual activity since puberty. Given the identity 
        category choices of heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or something else, 
        2.8% of men and 1.4% of women surveyed reported "some level of homosexual 
        identity." 
      <h3><A HREF="#Binson1995">Binson, Michaels, Stall, Coates, Gagnon, and Catania 
        (1995)</A></h3>
      <P>Data on the prevalence of homosexual behavior and the demographic distribution 
        of homosexual and bisexual men were analyzed from two national probability 
        surveys (General Social Survey - GSS and the National Health and Social 
        Life Survey - NHSLS) and a probability survey of urban centers in the 
        U.S. (National AIDS Behavioral Surveys - NABS) and results from earlier 
        surveys discussed. Combined data from the GSS and NHSLS surveys showed 
        5.3% of men reporting sexual activity with a same-gender partner since 
        age 18. Data from the NABS showed 6.5% of men reporting sex with men during 
        the previous five years. The highest prevalence was found in central cities 
        of the 12 largest SMSAs (14.4% since age 18) and among "highly educated" 
        White males (10.8%). 
      <h3><A href="#Sell1995">Sell, Wells, and Wypij (1995)</A></h3>
      <P>A later article on the Hope/Harris survey by Sell reported data on both 
        homosexual attraction as well as homosexual behavior. The figures reported 
        were: 6.2% of U.S. males and 3.6% of U.S. females with &quot;sexual contact 
        with someone of the same sex only or with both sexes in the previous five 
        years,&quot; and 20.8% of U.S. males and 17.8% of U.S. females with some 
        homosexual behavior or some homosexual attraction since age 15. The percentage 
        of respondents reporting sexual contact only with others of the same sex 
        in the previous five years in the U.S. was below 1%.

        <p>Data collected from a national sample of 13,495 men and women between 2006 and 2008. The study attempted to differentiate between sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual identity. The percentage reporting their sexual identity as homosexual ranged from 2% to 4% of males, and about 1% to 2% of females. The percentage reporting their sexual identity as bisexual is between 1% and 3% of males, and 2% to 5% of females. About 4%6% of males ever had same-sex contact. For females, the percentage who have ever had same-sex contact ranges from about 4% in the GSS, to 11%12% in the 2002 and 20062008 NSFG.</p>

        Sciences, Rogers and Turner analyzed estimates from five probability surveys, 
        1970 to 1990. They gave estimated minimums of 5-7% for males having experienced 
        some same-sex sexual contact in adulthood. 
      <h3><A href="#Diamond1993">Diamond (1993)</a></h3>
      <p>Diamond looked at studies done on the prevalence of homosexual behavior. 
        He included some studies done on populations outside the U.S. The date 
        ranges varied from country to country, but spanned 1948 to 1991. Those 
        studies discussed were compared and displayed in tablular form. He found 
        the mean of males surveyed to be 5.5% of the population, and the median 
        to be 5.3%. The mean of females that engaged in same sex behavior was 
        2.5% and the median was 3.0%. The calculations were of all non-Kinsey 
        data. Diamond found that methods employed by these studies were inconsistent. 
      <H3><A HREF="#Gonsiorek1995">Gonsiorek, Sell, and Weinrich (1995)</A></H3>
      <P>The authors reviewed methods used in defining and measuring sexual orientation, 
        and briefly critiqued surveys of homosexual activity from Kinsey in 1948 
        to the 1994 study by Laumann, et al. Because of the possible risks involved 
        in self-disclosure, it is posited that the recurrent 2-5% for same-gender 
        sexual behavior in the studies reviewed represents a minimum figure. They 
        suggest that the current prevalence of predominant same-sex orientation 
        is 4-17%. 
      <h3><A href="#Hewitt1998">Hewitt (1998)</a></h3>
      <p>Hewitt analyzed past surveys on the prevalence of homosexuality in the 
        United States, from 1970 to 1994, looking critically at the methodology 
        of these studies. He offered a metanalysis of the typologies used in these 
        surveys to classify the homosexual. He found five types: (1) open preferential 
        homosexuals, (2) repressed preferential homosexuals, (3) bisexuals, (4) 
        experimental homosexuals, and (5) situational homosexuals.

               <p>The Williams Institute advances sexual orientation law and public policy through
            rigorous, independent research and scholarship, and disseminates it to judges,
            legislators, policymakers, media and the public. A national think tank at UCLA Law, the
            Williams Institute produces high quality research with real-world relevance.</p>
               <p>Experts at the Williams Institute have authored dozens of public policy studies and law
            review articles, filed amicus briefs in key court cases, provided expert testimony at
            legislative hearings, been widely cited in the national media, and trained thousands of
            lawyers, judges and members of the public. By providing new ideas and reliable
            information, the Williams Institute makes a difference.</p>

	<p><!--begin paragraph--><p><span class="drop">A</span>s a presence in the worlda body hanging from a subway strap or pressed into an elevator, a figure crossing the streetI am neither markedly masculine nor notably effeminate. Nor am I typically perceived as androgynous, not in my uniform of Diesels and boots, not even when I was younger and favored dangling earrings and bright Jack Purcells. But most people immediately read me (correctly) as gay. It takes only a glance to make my truth obvious. I know this from strangers who find gay people offensive enough to elicit a remarkcatcalls from cab windows, to use a recent exampleas well as from countless casual social engagements in which people easily assume my orientation, no sensitive gaydar necessary. I&rsquo;m not so much out-of-the-closet as self-evident, to use Quentin Crisp&rsquo;s phrase, although being of a younger generation, I can&rsquo;t subscribe to his belief that it is a kind of disfigurement requiring lavender hair rinse. </p><!--end paragraph-->
</p>
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  


  

  

  

  



  

  
	<p><!--begin paragraph--><p>I once placed a personal ad in which I described myself as gay-acting/gay-appearing, partly as a jab at my peers who prefer to be thought of as str8 but mostly because it&rsquo;s just who I am. Maybe a better way to phrase it would have been third-sexer, the category advanced by the gay German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld 100 years ago. The label fell into disrepute, but lately a number of well-known researchers in the field of sexual orientation have been reviving it based on an extensive new body of research showing that most of us, whether top or bottom, butch or femme, or somewhere in between, share a kind of physical otherness that locates us in our own quadrant of the gender matrix, more like one another than not. Whatever that otherness is seems to come from somewhere deep within us. It mostly defies our efforts to disguise it. That&rsquo;s what we mean by gaydarnot the skill of the viewer so much as the telltale signs most gay people project, the set of traits that make us unmistakably one. </p><!--end paragraph-->
</p>
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  


  

  

  

  



  

  
	<p><!--begin paragraph--><p>The late psychologist and sexologist John Money famously called these the details of our gendermaps, which he believed are drawn primarily by life&rsquo;s experience and social conditioning. Money planted some of the earliest flags in the nature-versus-nurture war by claiming that dysfunctional parents, not inborn biology, is what produced sissy boys, tomboys, and other gender variants. But today, the pendulum has swung just about as far in the other direction as possible. A small constellation of researchers is specifically analyzing the traits and characteristics that, though more pronounced in some than in others, not only make us gay but also make us <em>appear</em> gay. </p><!--end paragraph-->
</p>
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  


  

  

  

  



  

  
	<p><!--begin paragraph--><p>At first read, their findings seem like a string of unlinked, esoteric observations. Statistically, for instance, gay men and lesbians have about a 50 percent greater chance of being left-handed or ambidextrous than straight men or women. The relative lengths of our fingers offer another hint: The index fingers of most straight men are shorter than their ring fingers, while for most women they are closer in length, or even reversed in ratio. But some researchers have noted that gay men are likely to have finger-length ratios more in line with those of straight women, and a study of self-described butch lesbians showed significantly masculinized ratios. The same goes for the way we hear, the way we process spatial reasoning, and even the ring of our voices. One study, involving tape-recordings of gay and straight men, found that 75 percent of gay men <em>sounded</em> gay to a general audience. It&rsquo;s unclear what the listeners responded to, whether there is a recognized gay accent or vocal quality. And there is no hint as to whether this idiosyncrasy is owed to biology or cultural influencesonly that it&rsquo;s unmistakable. What is there in Rufus Wainwright&rsquo;s uninhibited, yearning, ugly-duckling voice, as the Los Angeles <em>Times</em> wrote a few weeks ago, that we recognize as uniquely gay? Does biology account for Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s crisp trumpet and Charles Nelson Reilly&rsquo;s <em>gnyuck-gnyuck-gnyuck</em>? </p><!--end paragraph-->
</p>
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  


  

  

  

  



  

  
	<p><!--begin paragraph--><p>These are all part and parcel of the idea that being gay is differentthat we are different animals to some extent, says Simon LeVay, the British-born neuroscientist who has dedicated himself to studying these issues. Hirschfeld was right. I support the idea that we&rsquo;re a third sexor a third sex and a fourth sex, gay men and lesbians. Today, there&rsquo;s scientific documentation behind this.</p><!--end paragraph-->
</p>
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  


  

  

  

  



  

  
	<p><!--begin paragraph--><p>Richard Lippa, a psychologist from California State University at Fullerton, is one of the leading cataloguers of the many ways in which gay people are different. I caught up with him a few weeks ago at a booth at the Long Beach Pride Festival in Southern California, where he was researching another hypothesisthat the hair-whorl patterns on gay heads are more likely to go counterclockwise. If true, it will be one more clue to our biological uniqueness. </p><!--end paragraph-->

<p>A number of scientific studies have been conducted to test whether gaydar is real or just a popular myth. Perhaps the earliest study<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> asked people to judge sexual orientation from video clips, with results concluding that it was a myth. A later and more rigorous study published in a prestigious psychology journal showed that people could accurately judge sexual orientation.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> This study asked people to indicate their sexual orientation using the <a href="/wiki/Kinsey_scale" title="Kinsey scale">Kinsey scale</a> and then had others view very brief silent clips of the people talking using <a href="/wiki/Thin-slicing" title="Thin-slicing">thin-slicing</a>. The viewers rated their sexual orientations on the same scale and the researchers found a significant correlation between where the people said they were on the scale and where they were perceived to be on the scale. Sexual orientation was therefore perceived accurately just from nonverbal behaviors. Later studies have repeated this finding<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> and have even shown that home videos of children can be used to accurately judge their sexual orientation later in life.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Later studies found that gaydar was also accurate at rates greater than chance for judgments just from the face. Study participants use gendered facial cues and stereotypes of gay people to make their judgments, but reliably misjudge sexual orientation for people countering stereotypes.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The race, ethnicity, and nationality of neither the person making the judgment nor the person they are judging seems to make a difference when making judgments from faces.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Even individual facial features (just the eyes) can sometimes give enough information to tell whether a man or woman is gay, straight, or lesbian.<sup id="cite_ref-Pmid_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pmid-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Doijesp_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Doijesp-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> One study showed that judgments of menâs<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> and womenâs<sup id="cite_ref-Doijesp_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Doijesp-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> faces for about 1/25th of a second was enough time to tell whether they were gay, straight, or lesbian. Peopleâs judgments were not any more accurate when they had more time to make their judgments. Follow-up work to this suggested that gaydar happens automatically when someone sees another person and that seeing someoneâs face automatically activates stereotypes about gays and straights.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> People seem not to know that they have gaydar, though.<sup id="cite_ref-Pmid_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pmid-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Gay men have better gaydar than straight men<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> and women have better gaydar when they are ovulating.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> One study hypothesized that this might be because homosexual people are more attentive to detail than heterosexual people are, apparently as an adopted perceptual style aiding in the recognition of other homosexual people.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Other studies have found that men and women with body shapes and walking styles similar to people of the opposite sex are more often perceived as gay. The study, by <a href="/wiki/UCLA" title="UCLA" class="mw-redirect">UCLA</a> assistant professor Kerri Johnson, found that observers were able to accurately guess the sexual orientation of men 60 percent of the time â almost a coin toss; with women, their guesses didnât exceed chance. But whatâs most interesting to researchers is understanding how that snap judgment can unleash a series of stereotypes. Contrary to hype surrounding the study, the results suggest that walking styles and body shapes do not give away sexual orientation. The study was intended to reveal information about the perception of the observer, but has been misinterpreted as conveying reliable information about the sexual orientation of the participants. Gender-specific body movements are not reliably associated with a personâs sexual orientation<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> This is true of face shape,<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> but surprisingly not for voices,<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> even though people think they do.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> A handful of studies have investigated the question of gaydar from the voice.<sup id="cite_ref-Pmid_a_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pmid_a-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-bare_url_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bare_url-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> They have found that people can tell who is gay and straight from their voices but have mostly focused on men.

    <a href="/basics/narcissism" title="Psychology Today looks at Narcissism" class="pt-basics-link"> </a><h2>It's true: Some people really do have "gaydar."</h2><p>Until recently, the concept has been the stuff of urban legend. But in fact, according to a study conducted in 2005, some people are better at identifying gays than others, and overall, gays are better at it than straight individuals.</p><p>William Lee Adams, an undergraduate at Harvard College who studied the topic for his senior thesis, found that when volunteers quickly view a stranger with minimal informationâfrom neck-up photos and videos, without jewelry or makeupâhomosexual men and women are more accurate in identifying other homosexuals. Neither the viewers nor the videotaped volunteers knew the purpose of the study.</p><p>Gay men and women not only made more accurate assessments, they were efficient, too: It took about 2 seconds for gays to decide whether a person was straight or not. Says Adams, "You either have gaydar or you don't."</p><p>Of homosexuals, gay men were more easily recognized than lesbians, perhaps because of their visible niche in the entertainment world, says Adams. Gay women were more likely than men to be misclassified by both heterosexuals and homosexuals as straight.</p>  </div>

When gay and straight men and women sniff the underarm odors of othersâunsullied by deodorants or perfumesâgay men strongly prefer the <a href="/basics/scent" title="Psychology Today looks at Scent" class="pt-basics-link">smell</a> of other gay men, according to researchers at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. Lesbians, as well as straight men and women, find the scents of gay men least appealing.</p><p>Adams says it's unclear what cues gays are picking up on visually, but eye gaze may be key. He also thinks gaydar may have developed to help gays fulfill their need for affectionate relationships. "Gays often face isolation, depression and anxiety," says Adams. "Maybe gaydar is a coping mechanism."</p>
