<p>
Astronomy is the oldest of the sciences.  When Stoneage humans turned to an 
agrarian way of life and began to settle into communities, their interest must 
naturally have turned to the "heavens":

<ol>
<li> The seasons became important;  during different times of the year, 
different stellar patterns appear in the sky.  In the spring, 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/map/VIR.html">Virgo</a> and her 
accompanying constellations signal the time to prepare the earth, 
to plant crops, and to be wary of floods.  In the fall, 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/map/ORI.html">Orion</a> rises 
to indicate time to harvest and to prepare for winter.
<li>
The approximate equivalence of the human menstrual cycle and the 30 day 
orbital period of the Moon which produces 
<a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/vphase.html"> lunar phases</a> led to the 
belief that the heavens, and the Moon in particular, were related to fertility.
(What is the Moon's phase <a href="http://www.lunaroutreach.org/qpom/">right 
now</a>?)
<li>
To early humans facing an uncertain and changeable future, the constancy of 
the heavens must have suggested perfection and certainly led to deification 
in many cultures.
<li>
We may expect that 
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/edu/eclipses.htm">eclipses</a>
would have been especially frightening to early humans.  After predicting
the seasons, eclipse prediction may have been one of the earliest astronomical 
activities.
</ol>
<p>

<img align=LEFT valign=top src="./images/history/heelstone.gif"> 
<a href="http://witcombe.bcpw.sbc.edu/EMStonehenge.html">Stonehenge</a>, 
constructed between 3100-2000 BCE on  England's Salisbury Plain, may have 
been a Stoneage <a href="http://witcombe.bcpw.sbc.edu/EMStonehengeD.html">
astronomical site</a> (observatory is too strong a word), at 
least in part.  Certainly the alignment of the "heelstone" with the rising 
Sun on Midsummer's Day (June 21, the Summer Solstice) represents a true 
astronomical alignment, and many other Megalithic sites have similar 
alignments.  In <i>Stonehenge Decoded</i>, astronomer Gerald Hawkins argued 
that there exist a large number of astronomical alignments, though further 
study suggests that many of these are fortuitous.  <p>

Cosmologist Fred Hoyle has suggested that Stonehenge may have been used to 
keep track of the solar-lunar eclipse cycle.  Far outside the still partially 
standing ring of Sarsen Stones is a 
<a href="./images/history/Stonehenge_map.jpg">ring</a> of 56 holes, known as the 
Aubry holes.  Hoyle has noted that movement of a marking stone by 3
positions each time the Sun rose over the heelstone (or by one position
three times yearly) would complete a circle in 18.67 years -- approximately
the period for the "nodes", the intercepts of the lunar and solar paths in
the sky, to complete a cycle.

Certainly <a href="http://www.sacredsites.com/1st30/stonehen.html">ritual</a>
use of Stonehenge would have been more important that its astronomical 
functions and much of this interpretation must remain speculation.  We may 
be certain, however, that Stonehenge was indeed constructed by Stoneage humans 
without the assistance of alien astronauts as suggested in some 
pseudo-scientific books.  Visit the
<a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~ermace/sth/sth.html">Complete Stonehenge</a>
<p>

Eastern observers, notably the Chinese, kept careful track of events in the 
skies, particularly the appearance of "guest stars" -- comets, novae and 
other transients. Chinese records of the guest star that we now call 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html">
Comet Halley</a> can be traced back to 240 BCE and possibly as early as 
1059 BCE.
One of the most important Chinese records is of a 
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/96/22/crabhist.html">guest 
star</a> 
that was bright 
enough to be seen during the daytime for nearly a month in the 
constellation that we call Taurus in July 1054.  We believe this to be the 
supernova explosion that gave rise to the 
<a href ="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/twn/n1952.html"> 
Crab Nebula</a>, and our knowledge of the date of the explosion itself is 
a very important key in understanding the deaths of massive stars.
This event was also chronicled by the Anasazi in
<a href="http://www.chaco.com/park/archaeology/nebula.html">Chaco Canyon</a>
and by Native Americans elsewhere, but is curiously absent from European 
records in the Middle Ages.
<p>
As the above suggests,
<a href="http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/hist_astr/ha_items_archaeo.html">Archaeoastronomy</a> is an active and exciting field of research.<p>

Western scientific history begins with the ancient Greek civilization about 
600 BCE.<p><center>

The Ionian region of Asia Minor appears to have been a site of 
particular philosophical/scientific/mathematical activity for several 
centuries.</p>
<BR>
<p>  We will review the progress of science by highlighting a few key 
natural philosophers, scientists and mathematicians. As Isaac Newton
said,"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of
Giants."</P>

<h3><img align=LEFT valign=top src="./images/history/pythagoras.gif"> 
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Pythagoras.html">
Pythagoras of Samos</a> (~580-500 BCE) </h3> Most famous for his 
<A HREF="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/hamilton/ham.rttriangles.html">
theorem,</A> little is known of his actual work. He founded a school
(some would call it a cult) of natural philosophy and mysticism that 
attracted many followers.  The Pythagoreans lived by a strict regimen 
including vegetarianism, silence for the first 5 years of membership, and 
anonymity with respect to personal accomplishments (so that it is difficult 
to know what to ascribe to Pythagoras as opposed to his followers).  The 
Pythagorean Theorem was actually known to the early Babylonians, but it may 
be that Pythagoras was the first to prove it.  The Pythagoreans recognized the 
existence of irrational numbers and were interested in the relationship 
between music and mathematics.<p>

Pythagoras developments in astronomy built upon those of Anaximander from 
whom, apparently, came the idea of perfect circular motion.  The Pythagoreans 
believed that the planets were attached to crystalline spheres, one for each 
planet, which produced the 
<A HREF="http://einstein.stanford.edu/education/bibliography/newsci1.htm"><i>
Music of the Spheres</i></A>.  These spheres were centered on the Earth, which
was itself in motion.  Pythagoras is also credited with recognizing that the 
"morning star" and "evening star" are both the planet Venus.<p>

<h3><img align=RIGHT valign=top src="./images/history/aristotle.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristotle.html">
Aristotle</a> (384-322 BCE)</h3> Aristotle was a student of Plato, founding 
his own school of Natural Philosophy, the Lyceum, in Athens about 335 BCE. 
Aristotle's philosophy involved the qualitative study of all natural 
phenomena, pursued without the aid of mathematics which was deemed to  be 
too "perfect" for application on an imperfect terrestrial sphere.
In Aristotelian cosmology, the "imperfect" Earth was situated
at the center of the Universe (Solar System). It was composed of the four 
elements: earth, air, water, and fire,  each of which sought its natural 
place in the Universe (<i>e.g.</i> earthen bodies fall to Earth, rain falls 
from the sky, travelling through rivulets, to streams, to rivers and finally 
to the sea).  Aristotle adopted Pythagoras' model of concentric spheres for 
the planets, but deduced that the Earth must be immobile.  Aristotle's Natural 
Philosophy was embodied in the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas and became the 
foundation of Church doctrine and University instruction in medieval times.<p>

<h3>
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Aristarchus.html">
Aristarchus of Samos</a> (~310-230 BCE)
</h3>
<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekScience/Students/Kristen/Aristarchus.html">Aristarchus</a> 
concluded that the Solar System must be heliocentric, following his 
geometrical estimates of the
<a href ="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/aristarchus.htm">
relative sizes and distances of the Earth, Moon and Sun</a>.  His geometrical 
methods were perfectly correct, but the required observations of the 
<em>exact</em> time of first and third quarter Moon and the duration
of lunar eclipse were beyond the instrumental capabilities of his era.
He calculated that the Sun is about twenty times farther away than the Moon, 
about 20 times larger than the Moon and ten times bigger than the Earth. 
Unfortunately, all of Aristarchus work was lost in the great fire in 
Alexandria which destroyed the magnificent
<A HREF="http://peicommerce.com/HISTORY/EUROPE/GREECE/EGYPT/LIBRARY.HTM">
library </A>and its records of Greek science and culture.
A lunar <a href="./images/history/aristarchus.jpg">crater</a> bears his name 
in recognition of his accomplishments.


<h3>
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Eratosthenes.html">
Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> (276-197 BCE)
</h3>

Eratosthenes was a mathematician and geographer.  He developed a
<a href="http://www.kent.pvt.k12.ct.us/Departments/general_studies/maperat.htm">map of the world</a>, a method for finding prime numbers called 
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EratosthenesSieve.html">
Eratosthenes' Sieve</a>, and estimated the 
<a href="http://share2.esd105.wednet.edu/jmcald/Aristarchus/eratosthenes.html">
circumference of the Earth</a>.  His method involved determining the direction 
to the Sun in Alexandria at noon on the summer solstice and comparing this 
with the fact that the Sun is overhead in Syene(Aswan), about 500 miles away.
Here are the results of a worldwide high school

<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/psc/theman.html">
Claudius Ptolemy</a> (~85-165AD)
</h3>

Ptolemy, Alexandrian (Greek) mathematician, geographer, and astronomer, 
developed the most sophisticated 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/ptolemaic_system.html">
mathematical model</a> of the motions of the Solar System based upon the 
geocentric (Earth-centered) model and the principle of perfect circular 
motion.  His model was quite complex in order to follow the details of 
planetary motions, requiring circles (<i>epicycles</i>) upon off centered 
circular orbits.  His major astronomical work is known as

Nikolas Kopernig</a> (Copernicus, 1473-1543)
</h3>

Copernicus studied mathematics and astronomy in Cracow and Italy, but spent 
his life as a physician, attorney and church administrator.  By Copernicus' 
time, the Ptolemaic model could no longer reproduce the observed planetary 
positions.  Copernicus developed a 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/copernican_system.html">
heliocentric model</a> of the Solar System which retained the notion of 
perfect circular motion, but placed the Sun at the center and established 
the proper order of the planets outward from the Sun.  Copernicus model, a 
mathematical <i>tour de force</i> (not bad for an amateur), was published in 
<i> De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium</i> in 1543, the year of his death.

<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/People/tycho_brahe.html">
Tyge (Tycho) Brahe</a> (1546-1601)
</h3>
Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe is chiefly remembered for his meticulous 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/brahe.html">
observations</a>, made with <a href="./images/history/brahe_quadrant.gif">
instruments</a> of his own design before the advent 
of the telescope.  His early observations were carried out on the island of 
<a href="http://www.landskrona.se/kommun/kultforv/museum/Tycho/e_tycho.htm">
Hven</a> (now Swedish) where he built a pair of observatories, 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Images/Arch/Uraniburg/">
Uraniborg</a> and later Stjerneborg.  In 1572 he observed a supernova and 
in 1577 a comet. His parallax measures demonstrated that these objects were 
beyond the Moon, and his measures of the brightness of the supernova showed 
that it was clearly variable.  Tycho's measurements of planetary positions 
were at variance with the ptolemaic model. He developed his own 
<a href="./images/history/tycho_univ.gif">Solar System model</a> in which the 
Sun orbits the Earth, but the remaining planets orbit the Sun.  Tycho's
abrasive nature ultimately led him into disfavor. He moved to the court of
Rudolph II in Prague in 1599 where he would pass along his observations to
Johannes Kepler. These became the basis for Kepler's Laws of Planetary
Motion.


<h3><img align=right valign=top src="./images/history/gg.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Galileo.html">
Galileo Galilei</a> (1564-1642)
</h3>
There is an exquisite WebSite, <a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/">
The Galileo Project</a> about Galileo and his world put together by Rice 
University's History department. Many of the following links are to pages on 
this site.  Another excellent site at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is 
<a href="http://www.crs4.it/Ars/arshtml/arstitle.html">The Art of 
Renaissance Science</a>.
<p>

Galileo was the first "modern scientist".   He argued that mathematics, rather 
than being abstract perfection, is the true language of science.  He performed 
many revolutionary experiments in mechanics and other fields of physics.  
Among his accomplishments in mechanics are:

<ul>
<li> 
development of the concept of inertia, later refined by Newton.
<li>
a variety of experiments on falling bodies which demonstrated that the 
<i>acceleration of gravity</i>
<a href="./gloss#gravity"><sup><img src="./images/doodads/bk_sm.gif"></sup></a>
is independent of mass.  There is no evidence that 
Galileo actually dropped objects from the Tower of Pisa. 
Rather, his experiments were conducted with an
<a href="http://galileo.imss.firenze.it/museo/4/eiv13.html">inclined plane</a>
as shown in this 
<a href="http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/Animation/galileo.falling.html">
animation</a>.
<li>
the first Theory of Relativity, valid for velocities much smaller than the 
speed of light.
</ul><BR>
<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT"  SRC="./images/history/GGtelescope1.gif">Using telescopes of his 
own design and manufacture, Galileo also made many discoveries
in astronomy: 
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/sunspots.html">
sunspots</a> on the Sun and 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/moon.html">craters and 
mountains</a> on the Moon.

<li>
The so called 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu:80/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/jupiter_satellites.html">
"Galilean satellites"</a> which orbit Jupiter -- Io (with the volcanos), 
Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.  Here's 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu:80/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Student_Work/Astronomy95/jupiter.html">more</a> on Jupiter and her satellites from the 
<i>Siderius Nuncius</i> and an 
<a href="http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/Animation/galileo.moons.html">

<li>
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/saturn.html">rings</a>
of Saturn.

<li> the <a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Images/Astro/Venus/venus.gif">phases of Venus</a>.
</ul>

Galileo's observations suggested that the heavens were as "imperfect" as the 
Earth; that other objects in the Solar System have satellites which orbit 
around them, and that Venus passes through a full range of 
phases. These observations led him to the conclusion that the  
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/copernican_system.html">
Copernican Model</a> of the Solar System is preferable to the 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo//Things/ptolemaic_system.html">
Ptolemaic Model</a>.  Galileo published his views in Italian in <i> Dialogues 
Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</i> in 1632.  They were in direct
contradiction to the world-view taught by the Catholic Church, and he was 
called before the Italian 
<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/inquisition.html"> 
inquisition</a> in 1633. Galileo was forced to disavow his work, and was
sentenced to house arrest for the remainder of of his life.

<h3><img align=left valign=top src="./images/history/jk.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kepler.html">
Johannes Kepler</a> (1571-1630)
</h3>
<a href="http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/johannes.html">
Kepler</a> came to Prague to work with Tycho Brahe and his observational data. 
Kepler was a mathematician and mystic, interested primarily in numerical 
relationships among objects in the Universe.  Using Tycho's unprecedentedly 
accurate observations, he made highly precise calculations of 
planetary orbits.  Although he could come very close to matching Brahe's 
data with perfect circlular orbits, his faith in the data led him to continue 
his calculations until he matched Tycho's accuracy.  Kepler developed three 
mathematical
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/kepler.html">rules</a>
for the orbits of the planets:
<ol>
<li>
The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one focus.
<li> 
The planets sweep out equal areas during equal times of the orbit.
<li>
The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the planet's 
distance from the Sun. (If you measure the period in Earth years and the 
distance in Astronomical Units (1 A.U.= the average distance of the Earth 
from the Sun), then Period<sup><FONT SIZE=+1>2</sup></FONT> = Distance
<sup><FONT SIZE=+1>3</sup></FONT>.) </ol><p>
Here's a page with some nice <a href="http://www.cvc.org/science/kepler.htm">
animations</a> of Kepler's Rules, and here is 
<a href="http://observe.ivv.nasa.gov/nasa/education/reference/orbits/orbit_sim.html">another</a> way to play with them.
<p>

Obviously Kepler's Rules require that the Sun be the center of the Solar 
System, in contradiction with the Aristotilean ideal.  The first rule 
eliminates the circular motion which had been fashionable for 2 millennia.  
The second replaces the idea that planets move at uniform speed around their
orbits,with the empirical observation that the planets move more rapidly when
they are close to the Sun and more slowly when they are farther away.  The 
third rule is a harbinger of the 
<A HREF="http://beast.as.arizona.edu/textbook/equations/2_NULoG.html"> Law 
of Gravitation </A> which would be developed by Newton in the latter part 
of the 17<sup>th</sup> century.

<h3><img align=right valign=top src="./images/history/in.gif">
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Newton.html">
Isaac Newton</a> (1642-1727)
</h3>
Certainly the greatest classical Physicist, Newton developed the science of 
mechanics as we know it.  His first development was his 
<a href="http://acept.la.asu.edu/courses/phs110/course_info/class_notes/laws/laws.html"> Laws of Motion</a>.  In order to perform mechanical calculations and 
to understand Gravity, Newton invented a mathematical tool that he called 
"fluctions", now known as 
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html"> calculus</a>.  At the urging of <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Halley.html"> Edmund Halley</a>, Newton 
published his Laws of Motion and analysis of Gravity in the <i>Principia 
Mathematica</i>, probably the greatest physics text ever written, in 1687.
Halley, of course, wanted to use Newton's theories to analyze
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Orbits.html">
orbits</a>, particularly that of the comet of 1682 which now bears his name.

<p></center>
While not directly concentrating on Japanese or Asian astronomical study, the following sites support scholarly activity in the History of Astronomy, Archaeoastronomy, and Astronomy in Culture. Many carry articles or links of interest to readers involved in Asian studies.<p>
<ul><a href="http://www.insapvii.org/index.html"><b>INSAP (International Conference on The Inspiration of Astronomical Phenomena)</b></a>. Third Annual Conference was held in Palermo, Italy. Visit the site for more details.<p>
</ul><p>
<ul><a href="http://www.cultureandcosmos.org/"><b>Culture and Cosmos</b></a>. A journal supporting the scholarly study of astrology and cultural astronomy. Quoting from the page:<p>
<i><b>Culture and Cosmos</b> is a bi-annual peer-reviewed journal devoted to the study of the history of astrology and cultural astronomy. If astrology is the use of celestial phenomena to provide meaning for human life, then cultural astronomy is the broader use of astronomical beliefs and theories to regulate and inform society, politics, the arts and every aspect of human life.<p>
</i></ul>
<ul><a href="http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~pbrosche/astoria.html"><b>Astronomiae Historia / History of Astronomy</b></a>. Maintained by Wolfgang Dick, this page remains a primary starting point for those interested in all aspects of scholarly pursuit in the history of astronomy and astronomy in culture.</ul><p>
<ul><a href="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~tlaloc/archastro/index.html"><b>The Center for Archaeoastronomy</b></a>. The primary purpose of the Center is to advance research, education and public awareness of archaeoastronomy. In combination with the International Society of Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture, the Center supports scholarly research in history of astronomy and cultural astronomy throughout the globe.</ul><p>
<ul><a href="http://www1.archaeoastronomy.org/"><b>The Oxford Conferences on Archaeoastronomy</b></a>. Paraphrasing goals stated on the page, the Oxford Conferences on Archaeoastronomy are meetings that focus on the role that astronomical phenomena have played in human societies. The conferences serve as a meeting place for those working in anthropology, archaeology, history and prehistory, archaeoastronomy, and other studies of human cultures. </ul><p>
<ul><a href="http://sundials.org"><b>The North American Sun Dial Association</b></a>. As stated on the page, the North American Sundial Society is an association of people from a wide variety of disciplines who are interested in the study, development, history, and preservation of sundials and the art of dialing throughout the continent. Despite its reference to "the continent", the Association supports research in the use of time pieces historically in many cultures.</ul><p>

<h2>An Exhibition of Rare Books from the Collection of the Linda Hall Library</h2><p>
<p>This exhibition of forty-three star celestial maps and atlases was first presented to the public at the Linda Hall Library
from November 1, 1995 to February 1, 1996.  Because of its popularity, and because of continued requests for a printed catalog,
we reinstalled the exhibition in 2007, May 17 through November 30, accompanied by a companion exhibition of recently acquired star maps
and atlases, called Further Out.</p>

<p>Splendid color catalogs are available for both exhibitions.  You may order copies of the catalogs for both Out of This World

You are recommended to visit also the directory of
the German newsletters (<a href="/~pbrosche/aa/ema/">EMA</a>).
In most cases the EMAs contain also texts in English,
and the latest issue may contain urgent information such as conference
announcements, which has not yet been published in ENHA.

<p>
Since the translation into English usually takes some time (from days to
weeks or even months), there may be also items in the latest issues which have
not yet been translated. Starting with No. 25, some items will not be
translated at all. So, if you have a knowledge of German, you may be interested
in the latest EMAs, too.

Apart from the Vikings, who without a doubt navigated and kept track of time by 
means of the stars, the first important Danish astronomer was Peder Nightingale. 
In 1274 he observed the latitude of the Sun from Roskilde where he was a canon, 
and based on these observations he made tables showing the length of days and 
nights. Later he published a widespread calendar in Paris. There is some 
indication in the sources, that he didn't believe in the relation between 
astrology and astronomy, which was the common belief at that time.<BR>
In 1417 &quot;<i>Speculum Planetarum</i>&quot; were published by Johannes Simones de 
Selandia a book about the movements of the planets. Very little is known of 
Johannes.</font>

Longomontanus.</font>
</Center><P>
<font color="#000000">
The most famous Danish astronomer was <a HREF="life.htm">Tycho Brahe</a>, who 
was born as a nobleman in 1546. As a teenager he went to the University of 
Copenhagen to study civics, which was important for a young nobleman at that 
time because the leaders of Denmark were a group of rich noblemen (many of whom 
were related to Tycho). However, the young man was more interested in the stars, 
and on a long study tour around Europe he met many of the leading astronomers of 
his time. On this trip he also lost a part of his nose in a duel, and the rest 
of his life he had to wear a silver-nose. <Br>
In 1572 a supernova in Cassiopeia appeared. Tycho saw it and wrote a book about 
the new star; he proved that the star was as far away as the other stars, and 
this revolutionary idea made him famous all over Europe (the common belief was, 
that everything <a href="komet.htm" Alt>outside</a> the orbit of the Moon was 
made of the never-changing fifth element).<Br> 
To prevent him from moving abroad, the king Frederik II, gave him the island of <a href="hven.htm" Alt>
Ven</a> in Øresund, from where he observed the stars for 21 years. On Ven, Tycho 
constructed a small castle, <a href="uranib.htm" Alt>Uraniborg</a>
(the castle of Urania), which had instruments under the roof, as well as an 
observatory called
<a href="stjerneb.htm" Alt>Stjerneborg</a> (the castle of the Stars). He had a 
residence in Copenhagen, and in 1589 he got permission to make an observatory at 
the Watermill tower, one of the towers in the town wall. <Br>
His main interest was astrometry, and he invented many new and very accurate 
instruments for the study of this. He got into trouble with the new king, 
Christian IV, in 1597, and left Denmark. In 1599 he became court astronomer in 
Prague, but in 1601 he died. <Br>The most important among his posthumous 
astronomical work was a star-table so accurate that it was first surpassed by 
Flamsted in 1729, a new and better theory for the movement of the Moon and 
accurate positions of the planet Mars, which made it possible for Kepler to find 
his three famous laws.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
One of Tychos cooperators, Christian Longomontanus, became the first professor 
of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen, and in 1610 he received funds for 
instruments and he probably constructed a small observatory at his home.<Br>
Astronomy became very important in the 17th century in Europe, mainly due to the 
fact that the European countries began their rivalry to establish colonies. It 
was necessary to navigate across the oceans and therefore many State 
observatories were established; the first in 1632 in Leiden, Holland, and only 
five years later the Round Tower Observatory (Its first name was &quot;STELLÆBURGI 
REGII HAUNIENSIS&quot;). Longomontanus, who was already very old, was appointed the 
first director of the observatory at the Round Tower. The original idea was that 
there should be an observatory just like Stjerneborg at the top, which is why 
the diameter of the Roundtower and the size of Stjerneborg are exactly the same.</font>

<Center><font color="#000000" size="1">The astronomers Ole Rømer and Peder 
Horrebow.</font>
</Center>
<P><font color="#000000">The next important Danish astronomer was Ole Rømer, who 
as a student came from Århus to Copenhagen in the mid-1660s, where he studied 
astronomy. When the French astronomer Picard came to Denmark to determine the 
correct position of Uraniborg, he appointed Rømer as his assistant. He followed 
Picard back to Paris, and here he became a member of the Royal French Academy.<Br>
In Paris he made his famous and fundamental discovery of the limited <a href="light.htm" Alt>
velocity of light</a> by observing the delay of observed moon eclipses around 
Jupiter compared with predictions.<Br>
After his return to Denmark in 1681, he became the director of the Round Tower 
where he placed a
<a HREF="planete.html">planetarium</a>, and here, in Denmark, he introduced the <a href="1690.htm" Alt>
telescope</a> and pendulum clock as pointing devices in astronomical 
instruments. He later invented the
<a href="refrak.htm" Alt>transitinstrument</a> and the <a href="meridian.htm" Alt>
meridian circle</a>. His problems with temperature corrections led him to invent 
a thermometer, where the scale was founded on two fixpoints (the freezing- and 
boilingpoint of water), and therefore universal, an idea <a href="tempeng.htm" Alt>
Fahrenheit learned</a> from him in 1708.<Br>
Rømer had a lot of other jobs which kept him away from astronomy. He was a 
Supreme Court judge, a police master, chief of the fire brigade, made a new 
measuring system (he founded every other unit on only one unit (a foot)), he 
introduced the Gregorian calendar in Denmark, etc.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
Among Rømers pupils, P. Horrebow tried to follow the tradition of his master. 
Most of his findings were due to Rømer who published very little. Among other 
things, he found the sun parallax, 9&quot;, an approximative solution to the Kepler 
equation and the Horrebow-Talcott method for the determination of polar altitude.<Br> 
He was succeeded by his son Christian, who observed the Venus passage in 1766 
and discovered the periodicity of the sunpots.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
The last important director of the Round Tower was T. Bugge, who bought modern 
instruments and published many papers. His most important work was, however, his 
leadership of the first precise mapping of Denmark, carried out under the 
auspices of The Royal Danish Scientific Society.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
After Bugge, the scientific work declined. The instruments grew bigger and 
bigger, but the tower could not be enlarged, so in 1861 the observatory was 
moved to Øster Vold, where a new observatory was constructed on the remains of 
the Copenhagen fortification rampart. The well-known astronomer, H. L. D'Arrest, 
was elected to plan the new observatory. His main work was in spectroscopy, and 
he discovered, for the first time, the differences in the evolutionary state and 
spatial distribution of stars.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
The next director of the Øster Vold Observatory was Thiele, a skilful 
mathematician who developed a new method of determining the orbit of 
doublestars. He founded the tradition for numerical computational mathematics, 
which has lasted up to modern times.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
Under the direction of Ellis Strömgren, the computational work continued, and 
during World War I the international central bureau for the exchange of news (comets, 
novas etc.) was moved from Kiel to the <A HREF="http://www.astro.ku.dk/history.html">
Øster Vold Observatory</A>. And from 1922 until 1965 the central bureau under 
the International Astronomical Union had its residence in Copenhagen.<Br>
Ellis Strömgren was succeeded by his son
Bengt. He made the pioneering discovery that hydrogen was the most abundant 
element in the stellar interior, and he was the first one to make the correct 
interpretation of the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (the relation between the total 
energy output from a star and its surface temperature was independently found by 
the Danish chemist
<a HREF="hertz.html">Hertzsprung</a> and the American astronomer Russel) . 
Around 1950, he developed the UVBYß photoelectric system, which is still in use 
today.<Br>
In the 1950's a new observatory was constructed in Brorfelde near the town of 
Holbæk, it was provided with a very fine meridian circle and a Schmidt camera.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
In 1962, ESO (European Southern Observatory) was established. An observatory on 
the La Silla Mountain in Chile was constructed. Denmark has several telescopes 
there, one of which has an excellent 1,5m mirror.</font><P>
<font color="#000000">
In collaboration with other European countries, an observatory was constructed 
in the 1970's on the Spanish island of La Palma. Today, the meridian circle from 
Brorfelde has been moved to La Palma and is now functioning automatically in a 
collaboration between Denmark, Greenwich Observatory and the Spanish naval 
observatory in San Fernando. Here, Danish astronomers (today working at <A HREF="http://www.astro.ku.dk">
The Astronomical Observatory of the Copenhagen University </A>) have access to 
many big telescopes, among others the 2,5m Nordic Optical Telescope.</font>

<u>INTRODUCTION</a></u><br>
</B>
<p>
Colloquium IAU 72 is the first IAU-sponsored activity in this country, 
and it therefore seemed appropriate to include a paper on Astronomy in Israel.
With the highly singular history of this nation, the scene will move
from Eretz-Israel<a href=#note1><sup1>*</sup1></a> to Babylon 
(present day Iraq) and to Europe before returning to this area.
<p><br>
<u><b>MEGALITHS</a></b></u><br>
<p>
Prehistoric astronomical activity is represented by a <b>Stonehengelike 
megalithic circle and "Observatory" at Rujm-el-Hiri</b>, near Yonathan
in the Golan, the Westernmost sector of the historical Bashan plateau 
<a href=#ref1>[1]</a>
dating from the IIIrd Millenium BC. Star worship is mentioned
in the Old Testament <a href=#ref2>[2]</a> as beeing common among the 
Canaanites<sup1>*</sup1>, but the Bashan inhabitants who built that Golan megalithic circle antedate the Canaanites. Very little is known about them and the presumably religous role of their edifice. 
To the IIIth Century BC Israelitis, they
appeared as the work of giants (Refa'im, also Anakim, Emim, Zuzim), and
this is probably the source of the legends about races of giants that had
lived in Eretz-Israel prior to the Israelite conquest - including the
characterization <i>"a remnant of the giants"</i> for 
<a name=og><b>Og</b></a>, King of Bashan, in Deuteronomy and Joshua 
<a href=#ref3>[3]</a>. 
Indeed, the Rujm-el-Hiri circle is just one
among many megalithic remains in the Bashan, probably at the origin in
Greece and England (the "Giant's Dance" = Stonehenge). 
<p><br>
<u><B>ASTRONOMY IN THE MISHNA</a></B></u><BR>
<p>
The Israelitis' abstract monotheism and their centering of intellectual
creativity on ethical issues were detrimental to a natural development
of observational science, as did happen in Sumeria or Greece.
However, the requirements of agriculture induced a cycle of holidays
that were incorporated in time into Judaism and were given Ethnical or
National religious significance. There thus developed a need for an
understanding of the recurrence of seasons and for a synchronized
calendar fitted to Solar, Lunar and Sidereal time 
<a href=#ref4-6>[4-6]</a>. Several of the
Mishnaic scholars 
<a href=#note2><sup1>**</sup1></a> were versed in Astronomy, such as the
"Tannaim" <b>Yehoshua ben Zakkai</b> <a href=#ref7>[7]</a>, the Patriarch <b>Gamliel II</b> and in particular <b>Yehoshua (=Joshua) ben Hananiah</b> <a href=#ref8>[8]</a>. In the tractate Horayoth, dealing with errors of Justice, the following anecdote is related 
<a href=#ref9>[9]</a>:
<p>
<ul>
"Rabbi Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua went together on a voyage at sea.
Rabbi Gamliel carried a supply of bread, Rabbi Yehoshua carried a similar 
amount of bread and in addition a reserve of flour. At sea, they used up 
the entire supply of bread and had to utilize Rabbi Yehoshua's flour reserve.
Rabbi Gamliel then asked Rabbi Yehoshua - <i> "Did you know that this trip would last longer than usual, when you decided to carry this flour reserve?"
</i> Rabbi Yehoshua answered - <i>"There is a star that appears every 
70 years and induces navigational errors. I thought it might appear and cause us to go astray."</i> Rabbi Gamliel then exclaimed 
<i>"You are so knowledgeable and you nevertheless have to travel to make a 
living?"</i> Rabbi Yehoshua then answered bitterly - 
<i>"How come you are so surprised? Do'nt you know that two of your own students Rabbi Eliezer Hisma and Rabbi Yehohanan ben Gudgada who are so smart that they can tell you how many drops there are in the ocean, have neither
bread to eat nor clothes to wear?"</i>
</ul>
<p>
This observation is generally interpreted as relating to Halley's Comet
<a href=#ref10 > [10] </a>,
with a period aproximating 76 years. Observing a comet's periodicity, with 
such a long period, requires records covering many centuries; it is possible
that the Mishnaic scholars did inherit such records from the Great Knesset
scholars (before 300 BC) who received them during the Babylonian exile
(586-537 BC) from the "Chaldeans" (i.e. from Sumer, Akad etc. going back
to the IIIrd Millenium BC). Indeed, the Hebrew agricultural names of the
months <a href=#note3><sup1>***</sup1></a>
were replaced by Sumerian and Akadian names after the Babylonian
captivity. However, there is perhaps a difficulty with the dates:
Rabbi Yehoshua was born in 35 AD and died in 117 AD. Rabbi Gamliel died in
115 AD. The only appearance of Halley's Comet in the interval 55-155
(when Yehoshua was older than 20), is in 66 AD. Rabbi Gamliel was younger
then Rabbi Yehoshua and it has been argued that if he was 20-25 years old, it is doubtful whether he could have had students at the time
<a href=#ref10 > [10] </a>. Still, this
is not a strong argument, as Rabbi Gamliel II was also the hereditary
Patriarch, and may have had students attached to him formally from the
moment he was appointed head of the Sanhedrin.
<p>
Philippe Veron has, however
<a href=#ref11 > [11] </a>, come up recently with a different identification
of Rabbi Yehoshua's star, and argues that this was the variable Mira Ceti.
<p>
<b>Mar Samuel</b>, who became around 220 AD the Dean of the Talmudic Academy
of Nehardea in Babylonia, was an astronomer who could calculate
and adjust the calendar with great precision, intercalating an extra
month or reassigning the length of a month. The prescriptions for the
calendar adjustments were written down in a special Baraita<sup1>**</sup1>.
They include the 19 years synchronization cycle to this very day in the
<b>Jewish Calendar</b>.

<p><br>  
<u><B>SPAIN AND PROVENCE</a></B></u>
<a href=#ref12>[12]</a><BR>
<p>
Science spreads by convection. When Khushru Anushirvan, Sassanid Emperor
of Persia, signed a ten year truce with Justinian of Byzance, he 
ensured the continuity of science by requesting that the teachers of the 
recently abolished Academy of Athens be transferred to Persia. In his
fanaticism, Justinian was then trying hard to put an end to Judaism at
the sametime eradicating Neo-Platonicism and what was left of Greek
science. The Neo-Platonicists settled in Mesopotamia under Persian rule,
and their school was already flourishing when Persia was conquered by
Islam. Mathematics and Astronomy thrived  (e.g. Omar Khayyam, whose
Rubayat was just a hobby, his professional creativity having yielded
methods for solving factorizable cubic equations etc.) and spread all
over the new Mohammedon Empire. The Jews were active participants, and
the first Arabic-languate treatise on the Astrolabe was written by the
Jew <b>Joel</b>, known as <b>Masha-Allah</b> of Basra (Iraq) around the year 800. This is the treatise that was translated into English by Geoffrey Chaucer
(<i>"The Treatise on the Astrolabe"</i>) around 1380, from a prior Latin
translation. Masha-Allah also wrote a book on Lunar and Solar Eclipses,
that was later translated into Hebrew by <b>Abraham Ibn Ezra </b>
(<i>"Sefer be kadrut ha levana ve ha shemesh"</i>")
<p>
<b>Sind ben Ali</b>, a heretic Jew, was the main contributor (~830) to the 
astronomical tables of the Caliph Maimum. The scene now shifts to Spain,
where <b>Abraham bar Hiyya Hanasi</b> ("The Prince") of Barcelona (d. 1336)
improved on these tables, using calculations performed by the Arab
astronomer Al-Battani (d. 929). Abraham bar Hiyya was a prominent
mathematician and astronomer, and wrote famous textboks in both fields.
He introduced Europe to (Arab) trigonometry in his 
<i>"Treatise on Mensuration and Calculations"</i>. The Hebrew was translated
by Plast of Tivoli into Latin in 1145 and his book served as main source
material for that later work of Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa. In Astronomy,
his book <i>"The Shape of the Earth"</i> is based upon the Ptolemaic system,
contains a roughly correct estimate of the distance to the Moon (but the
wrong distance to the Sun). The principles for Calender intercalation make
up yet another book.)
<p>
His student, <b>Abraham Ibn Ezra</b> (1089-1164), poet, philosopher, Biblical
commentator and Astronomer, spent the last part of this life travelling
in Italy and France, ending up in Eretz-Israel. He continued the 
publication of tables, mostly on the movement of the planets. The
<i>"Toledo Tables"</i> were compiled by 12 Jewish astronomers led by
the Cordovan Arab astronomer Ibn Arzarkali ("Azarchel"). The Latin version
(translated by John of Brescia and Jacob Ibn Tibbon) was further improved
in 1272 by a group of astronomers led by Isaac Ibn Said, and is known
as the <i>"Alphonsine Tables"</i>.
<p>
<b>Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon's</b> (=Maimonides) main contribution to Astronomy
in his complete <b>rejection of Astrology</b> (1194). He is is unique, throughout the Centuries, in making this clear-cut. Remember that Kepler was still drawing horoscopes! Perhaps this should justify a visit to Maimonides' tomb in Tiberias.......
<p>
<b>Rabbi Levi ben Gershom</b> ( = Gersonides, also Maestre Leo de Bagnols,
Maestre Leo Hebraeus; 1288-1344), was one of the greatest of Medieval 
astronomers. He lived in Provence, mostly at Orange. As a mathematician,
he rediscovered the law of sines and published a sine table, correct to
the 5th decimal. As an astronomer (he wrote 136 "chapters"!), he is the
first to have relied on his own observations (in his studies of eclipses)
rather than on Ptolemy's. He invented <i>"Jacob's staff"</i>, a navigational
instrument which was widely used for 3 centuries, and was the first
person kown to have used a Camera Obscura for his observations.
<p>
Rabbi Levi is also the first scientist to derive more realistice estimates of
the distance to the fixed stars. 
Ptolemy's estimate was of the order of 
10<small><b><sup>-5</sup></b></small> light years 
( a million times smaller than the distance to the nearest star), 
whereas Rabbi Levi reached a figure of about 
10<small><b><sup>5</sup></b></small> light years, 
10 times our present estimate for the distance to an average star 
in the Galaxy. Gersonides was also one of the greatest 
Medieval philosophers and published  Commentaries to the Bible.
<p>
The <b>Zohar</b>, a compilation of Jewish mystic writings drawn in Spain
in the XIIIth Century anticipates Copernicus by stating that 
<i>"the whole earth spins in a circle like a ball; the one part is up when
the other part is down; the one part is light when the other is dark;
it is day in the one part and night in the other"</i>.
<p>
Jewish astronomers played a key role in the theoretical preparation
of the great voyages of discovery in the XVth Century. <b>Judah Cresques</b>,
forced to adopt Christianity in the massacres of 1391, later became the
Director of the Prince Henry of Portugal's ("The Navigator") Nautical
Academy of Sagres. <b>Abraham Zacuto</b> (<b>"Zacut"</b>, 1452-1515) worked first at Salamanca but moved to Portugal after the expulsion from Spain.
As Court Astronomer to Kings John II and Manuel I, he prepared the voyage
of Vasco da Gama (1496) and supplied instumentation (include his newly
perfected copper astrolabe), improved tables, charts, intruction and briefs.
He developed the first copper astrolabe. His very precise predictions
of eclipses were used by Columbus to threaten the natives at a dangerous
moment. Like all Jews, Zacut had to flee Portugal in 1497 and went to
Tunis. He died in Eretz-Israel.
<p>
<br>
<u><B>MODERN TIMES</a></B></u><BR>
<p>
The XVI-XVIIth Centuries were centuries of Jewish sufferings, and
contributions to Astronomy are less prominent, except perhaps for the
Herschel family, of Jewish origin. It was only when Alexander von Humboldt
became President of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, that he abolished
the requirement of a Christian Oath by a Professor at his ordination.
Karl-Gustav Jacobi was the first Jew who did not have to abjure his faith to become a Professor. The oath was re-establised by von Humbold successor, but it was no more in existence when Einstein, Minkowski and Schwarzschild were ordinated.<br>

<br>
<u><B>MODERN ISRAEL</a></B></u><BR>
<p>
Until 1965, observational astronomy was entirely a matter of amateurs.
In that year we started astronomical research at 
<a href=http://www.tau.ac.il>Tel-Aviv University</a>,
and by 1969 we had a Department of Physics and Astronomy,
still the only one in the country in 1982. In 1971 we inaugurated, with the
help of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the 
<a href=http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il> Florence and George <b>Wise Observatory</b></a>
<a href=#ref13>[13]</a> at Mizpe-Ramon (altitude 950m.) in the Negev.
The telescope is a 40" Wide Angle Richtie-Chretien reflector. European
astronomers have often used the instrument. The most important observations
at the Wise Observatory have been:
<ol>
<li>the first optical identification 
<a href=#ref14>[14]</a> of an X-ray pulsar, Hercules X-1 (J. and N. Bahcall,
1972)
<li> the first direct verification <a href=#ref15>[15]</a> of Whipple's 
conjecture about comet-tails being composed of water 
(P. Wehinger and S. Wycoft, together with G. Herbig at Lick Observatory
and G. Hertberg and H. Liu in Canada, 1974)
<li> the discovery of Sodium <a href=#ref16>[16]</a> and Sulphur
<a href=#ref17>[17]</a> clouds around Jupiter, along the orbit of its satellite
10. (Y. Mekler, A. Eviatar and I. Kupo, 1974)
<li> the precise observation <a href=#ref18>[18]</a> of a recurrrent Nova
leading to a better understanding of the Nova mechanism (N. Brosch,
E. Leibowitz, 1978)
<li> the discovery <a href=#ref19>[19]</a> of the 13-day period in SS433
(E. Leibowitz, T. Mazeh, in coll. with the University of Oregon, 1979).
</ol>
<p>
We now have theoritical groups in almost all institutions in Israel.
The late G. Racah was honoured by the IAU for his work in Spectroscopy by
giving his name to a crater on the Moon, where he has thus joined the
company of Ibn Ezra, Rabbi Levi, Zacut, Jacobi and Einstein.

This is the name of this country since the XIIIth Century BC.
Outside of the Bible, it is first mentioned in a 1225 BC monument put
up by Pharaoh Merneptah at Beit-She'an in the Jordan Valley (now at the
Jerusalem Rockefeller Museum). Before, it was known as Cana'an.
The Cana'anites, called Phenicians by the Greeks, spoke the same language
as the Hebrews, but worshipped Baal and other deities instead of Yahveh.
They continued to live along the coast of present Lebanon to Roman times.
Cana'anites who settled in preset-day Tunisia at the end of the VIIIth
Century BC built Keret-Hadashat (the new city), pronounced Carthage 
by the Romans. Hannibaal (or Hananbaal) thus spoke a dialect of Hebrew.
His name means "Baal has forgiven" just as John (Johanan=Yehohanan also
Hanan-Yahu=Hananiah means "Yahveh has forgiven". The magistrates of
Carthage were known as Shofetim ("Suffetes"), "Judges".
("Patriarchs", then Shofetim=Judges, and then Kings).
<p>
The first Jewish Commenwealth lasted in various forms between 1700-586 BC.
King David installed his capital in Jerusalem around 1000 BC. 
The second Commonwealth started as an autonomous province of the 
Persian Empire, Judea with Cyrus the Great's declaration in 437 BC. 
The Hashmonean (or Maccabean, then Herodian) independent state of
Judea lasted from 167 BC to 44 AD (91 AD in the Golan), when it was
replaced by the Roman province of Judea, of New Testament renown. After
the Bar-Kochba rebellion of 135 AD, the Emperor Hadrian changed the 
name of the province to Palestine, to erase its connections with the
Judean ( = Jewish ) nation. Palestine and Judea appear as synonims during
the Crusades. Jewish autonomy in Galilee (the "Patriarchate" ) lasted
till 425, when the Byzantine Emperor refused to recognize a successor
to Gamliel VI. It was renewed for a short spell in 607-614. Galilee with its
schools and religious leadership was again central to the Jewish world
in the VII-Xth Centuries AD, and again in XVI Century. Modern Jewish
resettlement started in 1777 and accelarated after 1870. Policital Zionism
was created by Herzl in 1897 and received its Charter over the land in the
Balfour Declaration (1917) and the League of Nations Mandate (1921). 
The Third Commonwealth became in 1948 the State of Israel.
<p>
<a name=note2><font color=#0000ff><sup1>**</sup1></font></a>
The <b>Bible</b> (in particular the Old Testament) represents a 
selection of Hebrew literature, poetry, history, philosophy, etc. between
~ 1300-400 BC. The Apocrypha are works that existed around 100 AD, 
when the Old Testament was edited, and were not included.
The <b>Mishna</b> is an extensive legal code, (divided into six "Orders",
edited ~200 AD by the Patriach Yehuda the Prince in Tiberias, and 
representing a selection from the Proceedings of the Rabbinical academies
in Eretz-Israel between 300 BC and 200 AD. Its authors are knows as Taanaim.
The <b>Gmara</b> is a similar but much more extensive code, organized as
a Commentary on the Mishna. It was written in the academies of Galilee
(The "Jerusalem Talmud" stopping, though unedited, around 350 AD) and 
Babylonia ("The Babylonian Talmud" edited by Rav Ashi around 400 AF).
Its authors are known as Amoraim. The term <b>Talmud</b> covers both
Mishna and Gmara but often denotes the latter. The Talmud is divided into
"Tractatea". Discussions that were left out when the Mishna was edited are
known as Baraitoth, "externals".  
<p>
<a name=note3> <font color=#0000ff><sup1>***</sup1></font> </a>
The months in the Gezer (Halfway between Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem) calendar (1000 BC, now in the Instanbul museum) carry names
such as "the month of the oat harvest" etc. The months of the
present Jewish calendar represent the Babylonian Zodiac appelations,
sometimes named after Sumerian or Akedian deities (Tammuz, etc.) .

Now, given new formulations and  application of the distinction between atomic and ephemeris time, results will be slightly different.

      <p><font color="#000000">In the work <i>The Àryabhatiya of 
        &Agrave;ryabhata, An Ancient Indian Work on Mathematics and Astronomy, </i>translated by William Eugene Clark, Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard 
        University (The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois. 1930), 
        I found the following to be written:</font>

      <font color="#000000">As can be seen from the Clark translation &Agrave;ryabhata
       wrote that 1,582,237,500 rotations of the Earth equal 57,753,336 lunar orbits.
       (These same two numbers are also presented by G. R. Kay in his appendices,
       where they are attributed to &Agrave;ryabhata and Pus&iacute;la.) This is
        an extremely accurate ratio for two fundamental cosmic motions (1,582,237,500
        / 57,753,336 = <b><font color="#990000">27.3964693572</font></b>).</font>      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">Given
          Jan. 1, 2000 astronomical constants and given  the present day formulas
          to temporally adjust the astronomical constants,  I calculated that &Agrave;ryabhata's
          ratio was exact for 1604 BC.* The  resulting data is presented in Table
          1. The temporal variation formulas  used can be obtained from my <a href="astrofor.html">Astronomy
          Formulas</a> 
        page. The date AD 500 is the approximate epoch in which &Agrave;ryabhata
         wrote. &Agrave;ryabhata was born in 476 in Patna, India and died in 550.
          His Àryabhatiya was probably written in A.D 498.</font> 
        His sources remain obscure.

        <p align="left"  class="font10"><font color="#000000">While the majority of the ratios presented by &Agrave;ryabhata
            are not equally precise, it is difficult to believe that the earth rotations
            to lunar orbits ratio, given such very large numbers, could be so precise
            by coincidence. The odds of that being the case are astronomical. This
            is particularly so given that the data derives from an era when it was
            more exactive than today. If it derived from an ancient Vedic source,
            it was even more exactive when it originated.</font> Additionally, lunar orbit 
      and earth rotation are two of the three actual fundamental cosmic motions, 
      rather than the apparent day/night or lunar phase cycles.      </p>
      </center>
      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">According to G. R. Kay, &Agrave;ryabhata and the 
        Paulisa Siddanta present the values below for the lunar periods. Kay's 
        table of durations of sidereal and synodic months also quotes another 
        ancient Indian authority of the era, Paulisa Siddanta. Obviously the 
        accuracy of the ancient Indian astronomical data is not just coincidence.
           Note that the lunar orbit period of 27.321668 is accurate for the same
           epoch as the lunar orbit to earth rotations ratio quoted above. This is
           supportive of the suggestion that the information derives from an accurate
           ancient source.</font> <br />

      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">&Agrave;ryabhata wrote the Àryabhatiya in four chapters. 
        The first chapter presents the astronomical constants and sine tables. 
        Chapter II is mathematics required for computation. Chapter III discusses 
        time and the longitudes of the planets. Chapter IV includes rules of trigonometry 
        and rules for eclipse computations. &Agrave;ryabhata's work in effect 
        started a new school of astronomy in South India.</font> </p>
      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">&Agrave;ryabhata is the first known astronomer 
        to have initiated a continuous counting of solar days, designating each 
        day with a number. This 'count of days' is termed the 'ahargana.' His 
        epoch began at the beginning of the Mahayuga. To avoid excessively large 
        numbers, later astronomers changed the beginning of the epoch to the Kali 
        era, commencing at midnight of 17-18 February of 3102 B.C.</font> </p>
      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">The Àryabhatiya is a summary of Hindu 
        mathematics up to his time, including astronomy, spherical trigonometry, 
        arithmetic, algebra and plane trigonometry. Some of his formulas are correct, 
        others not. The first appearance of the sine of an angle appears in the 
        work of &Agrave;ryabhata. He gave tables of half chords (sine tables).</font> 
      </p>
      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">To the best of my knowledge, &Agrave;ryabhata's 
        ratio represents the earliest known recorded astronomic ratio with such 
        incredible accuracy. It surprises me that this fact has gone unnoticed 
        to this date (to the best of my knowledge). I suspect that this oversight 
        is due to our present day emphasis on days and years, rather than rotations 
        and orbits. Few readers today would recognize the ratio of rotations of 
        the earth per lunar orbit. Other author's have commented on the accuracy 
        of ancient Indian astronomy, though typically the ratios were assessed 
        in relation to the duration of the Mahayuga (4,320,000 years). It does 
        not surprise me that such an accurate astronomic ratio may have been known 
        to other cultures in earlier eras.</font> </p>
      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">&Agrave;ryabhata wrote that the apparent motion 
        of the heavens was due to the axial rotation of our planet. &Agrave;ryabhata 
        taught that the earth is a sphere and rotates on its axis, and that eclipses 
        resulted from the shadows of the moon and earth. &Agrave;ryabhata's innovations 
        were opposed by Hindu teachers. His teachings were not in accordance with 
        the religious views of his era.</font> </p>
      <p class="font10"><font color="#000000">&Agrave;ryabhata wrote, according to Clarke, "In 
        a yuga the revolutions of the Sun are 4,320,000, of the Moon 57,753,336, 
        of the Earth eastward 1,582,237,500, . . ." Given &Agrave;ryabhata's value 
        of 27.321668 days per lunar orbit period, the 57,753,336 lunar orbits 
        represent 4,320,027.33 solar orbits (in AD 500), not 4,320,000. Why? Perhaps 
        because the numbers are divisible by 60 and 6. The ancient Indians employed 
        base 60 math. I have no certain answer for this question. Perhaps religious 
        dogma had an influence in this matter. The accuracy of the ratios presented 
        should be considered valid, even though they do not match the exact time 
        intervals considered significant in Hindu cosmology. This inaccuracy poses 
        a question regarding the planetary numbers. Should they be compared to 
      the 4,320,000 years number or to the rotations and lunar orbits numbers?<br />

        response to the questions above, I have received few replies. I recently
        found a more accurate ratio expressed by Aristarchus' &quot;Great Year&quot; when
        interpreted as 4,876 solar orbits. While comparing accuracy I noted Kay's <font color="#000000">&Agrave;ryabhata </font>interval,
         57,753,339 lunar orbits (rather than Clarke's 57,753,336), 
        precisely equates to a
        integer of 4,320,027.0 orbits. The
           solar orbits to         lunar orbits ratio is  a more precise ratio than <font color="#000000">&Agrave;ryabhata's
        ratio of </font> rotations to lunar orbit. </p>
      <p class="font10">Since this article posted in 1997,  &quot;Kay
          notes 57,753,339 lunar orbits&quot; 
        has gone unnoticed as a solar orbit
        integer, as a clue to the more accurate constant. Given Kay's  lunar
        orbits interpretation  is  a precise integer of solar orbits and an
        even more accurate second &quot;great ratio&quot;        Kay's number has
        support as an intended interval, likely with 4,320,027 solar orbits. Half
        of <a href="aristarchus.html">Aristarchus' &quot;Great Year,&quot;</a> the
        2,438 solar orbits equaling 892,933 rotations interval, expresses an astronomy
        ratio with greater accuracy than <font color="#000000">&Agrave;ryabhata's </font>        ratios.
        I  now seek other citations of 'great year' intervals in ancient literature. </p>

      response to the Clark quote, Sunil Bhattacharjya provided the following Sanskrit translation of the <strong id="yui_3_2_0_1_1317780665866550"><em>Surya Siddhanta</em></strong>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Verse No. 12<br />
          Sixty Nadis is known as Nakshatra Ahoratra (ie. day and night together). Thirty of that (ie. Ahoratra) become one Masa (ie. Nakshatra Masa). Like that thirty Savana days with thirty Arkodaya or Sunrises is one Savana Masa or Savana month.</p>
        <p>Verse No. 13<br />
          The same way the Tithis also (ie. thirty Tithis make one Saumya or Chandra Masa). Like that one Sankranti to the other Sankranti (ie. from the entry of the Sun into one Rashi to the entry of the Sun in to the next Rashi) is called Saura Masa. Twelve of this (Saura Masa) is called Divya Varsha.</p>
        <p>Verse No. 14<br />
          What is Deva's day is Asura's night and what  is Asura's day is Deva's night. Six times sixty of that (i.e. 360 of the day and night)  make one Divya Varsha and Asura Varsha as well.</p>
        <p>Verse No. 15<br />
          12,000 of that Suryabda (ie. Divya / Asura Varsha) is Chaturyuga (or Mahayuga). Numerically it (Chaturyugas) is 4,320,000 (Ahoratras or days and night together).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="font10">Along with the following comments:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="font10">&quot;<span id="yui_3_2_0_1_1317780665866560">The Sanskrit verses of the Suryasiddhanta  are the same. ... In the 19th century CE some scholars ...  started interpreting the span of the Mahayuga as 4,320,000 years whereas  it is only 4,320,000 days.&quot;</span></p>

<b>1959:</b> Drs. Philip Morrison and Guiseppe Coconni publish in <i>Nature</i>
           magazine the first modern SETI article, "Searching for Interstellar Communication," which indicated the potential of using microwave radio for extraterrestrial communication.<p>

<b>1960:</b> The first SETI search, <i>Project Ozma</i>, is conducted by Dr. Frank
           Drake at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in
           Green Bank, WV using an 85-foot antenna tuned to
           the 21 cm (1,420 Mhz) line of neutral hydrogen.<p>

<b>1961:</b> The optical approach to SETI using continuous wave laser
           beacons is proposed by Drs. Robert Schwartz and Charles Townes.<p>

<b>1961:</b> The first SETI Conference, <i>Order of the Dolphin</i>, is held  at the National
           Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, WV. Dr.
           Drake introduces as its agenda what is  now know as
           the <i>Drake Equation</i>, a controversial statistical method
           for estimating the number of advanced technological civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy.<p>

<b>1962:</b> Following studies of Barnard's Star spanning his entire professional career, Dr. Peter van de Kamp concludes that the proper motion of this star can best be explained by the presence of one or more planets.  Today, the question of planets surrounding Barnard's Star remains unresolved.<p>

<b>1966:</b> Drs. Carl Sagan and I.S. Shkolovskii write "Intelligent Life in the
          Universe."<p>

<b>1971:</b> A NASA study team, <i>Project Cyclops</i>, is convened to create
          the design of an array of up to 1000 radio telescopes to detect
          Earth-type radio signals up to 1000 light-years away. Costs
          prevent implementation of the proposal at this time.<p>

<b>1971:</b> Drs. Carl Sagan, Frank Drake, and Phil Morrison join Russian
          scientists at the  joint US-USSR SETI Conference in Byurakan,
          Armenia, Soviet Union.<p>

<b>1972:</b> NASA publishes "Project Cylops, A Design Study of a System

							<h2>Biennial History of Astronomy Workshops</h2>
							<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20">

									<td width="50%" align="left" valign="top">
									  <h3>Overview</h3>
										<p>In 1993 the first Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop took place at the University of Notre Dame and launched what has become a stimulating forum for scholars of all levels and interests in the history of astronomy. Notable has been the workshop's attention to the teaching of the history of astronomy as well as the warm welcome given to graduate students and independent scholars.</p>
										<p>A workshop typically attracts 60-65 scholars who take part in a thematic program of talks, panel discussions, and, in some years, hands-on demonstrations. All aspects of the history of astronomy receive attention and across all time periods. Furthermore, the workshop's residential format ensures ample time outside of the scheduled meetings for participants to converse. When the weather allows, a visit to the Notre Dame Observatory is usually planned.</p>
										<p>An evening banquet with a well-known speaker tops off the workshop and helps to make this biennial gathering much anticipated among historians of astronomy.</p>
									<td width="50%" align="left" valign="top">
									  <h3>Upcoming Workshop</h3>
										<p>The Twelfth Biennial History of Astronomy Workshop is scheduled for 24-28 June 2015 at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, and will include a one-day trip to the <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/">Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum</a> in Chicago.</p>
										<p>Further details about this upcoming workshop, including the call for session and individual proposals, will appear towards the end of 2014.</p>

<b>ASTRONOMICAL REFERENCES</b>
<br><b>IN THE RUBA'IY&Acirc;T OF OMAR KHAYYAM</b>
<p><b>IMAD-AD-DEAN AHMAD</b>
<br><b>Minaret of Freedom Institute</b>
<br>4323 Rosedale Avenue
<br>Bethesda, MD 20814
<br>USA
<p>Delivered to the Third International Conference on the Inspiration of
Astronomical Phenomena, Mondell, Sicily, January, 2001
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>ABSTRACT.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Omar Khayyam was both an astronomer and
a poet.&nbsp; We examine the astronomical references in different translations
of his poetry and in Elihu Vedder's illustrations of the first American
edition of Edward Fitzgerald's famous translation as the takeoff points
for discussing the controversy as to the meaning of his poetry and the
differences in culture between 11th-century Iran where he wrote them and
19th-century Britain and America where Fitzgerald and Vedder respectively
were born.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Like Padre Piazzi whom this conference honours, Omar Khayyam had a theological
background, started a career in mathematics, and is noted in history for
achievements in astronomy.&nbsp; For centuries this eleventh century scholar
was best known for his treatise on algebra (that was used as text in Europe
until the eighteen hundreds), but since the nineteenth century he has been
best known as “The Astronomer-Poet of Persia” for his quatrains thanks
to Edward Fitzgerald's beautiful, but free-wheeling, translation. The ruba’iy&acirc;t
explore with vivid imagery, sly humour and profound thought the great questions
that have always absorbed mankind: life and death, the nature of being
and identity, the questions of the origin and destiny of all things.
<p>Coming from a society in which science and religion are viewed as antagonists,
Fitzgerald misconstrued Omar’s poetry as a materialist diatribe against
religious belief.&nbsp; Like all great poetry, Omar’s verse is so deep
and so rich in meaning that it can be understood on many different levels
and in different ways.&nbsp; Thus, many people from atheists to Christian
clerics, from materialists to mystics, have professed that Omar is one
of them.&nbsp; Speaking as an astronomer, I can say without fear of contradiction,
that Omar was definitely "one of us."&nbsp; For that reason it is appropriate
for this meeting to take a look at the astronomical allusions in his poetry
and compare how their interpretation is affected by cultural context.
<p>I here focus on the literary translations of the Iranian-American scholar
Ahmad Saidi (1991) and the British poet Edward Fitzgerald and the artistic
interpretations of the American artist Elihu Vedder who illustrated the
first American edition of the Rubaiyat (Fitzgerald 1884).&nbsp; Given the
location of this conference, I should mention that Vedder executed his
illustrations during his lengthy stay in Italy in the early 1880’s.&nbsp;
My research has also been informed by reviewing a number of literal translations,
notably those of Graves and Ali-Shah (1967) and Arberry (1952).
<p>Ahmad Saidi was raised in a cultural milieu as close as a contemporary
of ours can get to that of Omar himself.&nbsp; Fitzgerald, of course, lived
at that moment in Western history when Darwin’s theory seemed to many Westerners’
to put a final nail in the coffin of the Church’s side of a long battle
between reason and religion.&nbsp; Vedder, as befits a true artist, it
seems to me, sees all the possibilities in Omar’s poetry.&nbsp; Even though
he is working from Fitzgerald’s translation, his illustrations allow for
a broad range of interpretations of Omar’s deep poetry.

<p>The astronomical reference is clearly to the dawn, but the image is
starkly different in the two translations.&nbsp; Fitzgerald has dropped
the reference to Kai Khosrau, the famous Persian king.&nbsp; All that remains
is the suggestion that sun drives out the stars from the morning sky as
a British Imperial officer drives the enemy from the field.&nbsp; But Saidi
knows that Kai Khosrau renounced power at the pinnacle of his career, fearing
that retaining it after he completed his work would threaten his account
with God.&nbsp; Saidi understands, as Fitzgerald does not, that the wine
flung into the bowl of night (the red colour of dawn dropped in to the
dark sky) is an analogue to the pebble dropped in a bowl by the commander
signalling his own troops to break camp (also at dawn).&nbsp; The astronomical
markers that delimit the time in human affairs appear as metaphors throughout
the poem with various metaphysical implications about the lifetime of a
man, in particular, the poet.
<p>The mention of the false dawn in the second verse appears to be an interpolation
by Fitzgerald, yet the assumption that it must be such on the grounds that
the false dawn is a modern discovery is incorrect, since the phenomenon
is mentioned in a tradition of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
in warning not to mistake the false dawn for the true in setting the time
of breaking the fast:&nbsp; "The Prophet said, 'The Adhan pronounced by
Bilal should not stop you from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan
at night, so that the one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from
among you might hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up.
It does not mean that dawn or morning has started.' Then he (the Prophet)
pointed with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then
lowered them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas'ud imitated the gesture
of the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he
put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These
gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and right
horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is
not the real dawn [i.e., is the false dawn]."&nbsp; (Khan 1976)
<p>In verse 10 Saidi translates "And sour or sweet, why fuss since life
shall fly,/At Balkh or Baghdad—why care where we die?/Drink wine, for silv’ry
Moon will keep its beat/From full to new long after you or I."&nbsp; Fitzgerald
(verse 8) drops the reference to the Moon, speaking instead of "Leaves
of Life" falling.&nbsp; While the ephemerality of a single human life is
the same in both renditions, the Saidi version emphasizes the relative
durability of the moon's course.&nbsp; In the Muslim cosmology the moon
too will eventually end its travels, but only "long after you or I."

<p>Saidi makes more effecive use of the multiple significance of the Moon

that the moon will find neither lover nor beloved (or is it poet and reader?),

<p>Both translations reflect geocentric cosmology, but Saidi's implies
the Islamic distatse for astrology with the mention of "barriers of fake

sceintific research has resovled one problem after another, but not the
main one, what happens to us after death, to which only revelation gives
the answer.&nbsp; In the picture above Vedder depicts the muse sitting
on a modern conception of Saturn while in the picture below we see the
astronomer ponder a naked-eye vista of the sky.

<p>Omar compares the universe to shadow-show.&nbsp; The sun, illuminating
the physical universe is the metaphor for God illuminating the spiritual
universe.&nbsp; In Saidi's translation&nbsp; the focus is the standard
Muslim view that God is the true reality and and all else the contingent
reality.&nbsp; For Fitzgerald the focus is on the implications for a deterministic
universe such as Newtonian physics had inspired in the philosophy of his
time.&nbsp; Similarly note in the verses below rejecting the notion of
appealing to the physical heavens for help that Fitzgerald paints the heavens
only "as" impotent as man, while Saidi renders the translation "a thousand
times more" helpless.

<p>Saidi’s translation lacks the verse mentioning Jupiter and the Pleiades
(Parwin and Mushtari), but his translation of the concluding verse in the
thread (Saidi, v. 165) shows that Omar’s quarrel is not with God, but with
those who profess to be His interpreters but achieve no communion with
the All-Merciful (as He is repeatedly called in the Qur’an) in their rituals.
<p>I think Vedder has seen through to the true heart of Omar’s poetry with
his swirl that forms the backbone of all his illustrations of the poem.&nbsp;
Obviously Sufis and hedonists are equally comfortable interpreting Omar’s
wine as they wish, whether as the love of God or the juice of the grape.&nbsp;
But all must admit that Omar is fascinated with time.&nbsp; His focus,
like the pivot of Vedder's swirl, is on the present moment.&nbsp; Fitzgerald
is well aware of this, but he overstates the case in this verse, which
is absent from the Saidi and Graves-Ali-Shah editions:
<p>Ah, but my Computations, People say,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduced
the Year to better reckoning?—Nay, 'Twas only striking from the Calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Fitzgerald, v. 60]
<p>Omar’s quarrel is with those who would insist on sacrificing the certain
present for an uncertain future.&nbsp; The Qur’an itself supports Omar
when it says:&nbsp; “… nor forget thy portion in this world, but do thou
good as God has been good to thee…” (Ali 1988, 27:77).
<p>The Qur’an says that there is only one unforgivable sin, and that is
to assign partners to God.&nbsp; Thus, Omar expresses his hopes for forgiveness
in the following quatrain, missing from Fitzgerald’s translation.&nbsp;
It is mathematical rather than astronomical in inspiration, but I can’t
resist concluding with it.&nbsp; Omar declares that in avoiding the unforgivable
sin (Ali, 1988, 16:51), he has hope for God's mercy:
<p>The pearl of worship though I did not thread,
<br>Nor wiped the dust of sin from off my head,
<br>I don’t despair of mercy of Thy Court,
<br>Because I never ‘One is two’ have said.
<br>[Saidi, v. 163]

<B>Summary<BR>
<BR>
For a long time, two separate lines of thought governed our perceptions of tidal friction. Empirical evidence from observations of solar eclipses made as early as in Antiquity pointed to a secular acceleration of the mean angular motion of the Moon amongst the stars which was first noted by Edmund Halley in 1695. However, according to the solitary theoretical speculations of the philosopher Immanuel Kant (1754), oceanic tides retarded the rotation of the earth. When did these two lines of thought converge?</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1786, Simon Laplace showed that conservative celestial mechanics could explain empirical observations on the acceleration of the lunar orbit. Some 70 years later, Adams (1853) and Delaunay (1859) demonstrated that Laplace's explanation was only half an explanation. The other half was buried in the work of Isaac Newton who thought that the apparent acceleration of the moon could be due to a change in the earth's rotation. Robert Mayer was the first to link the ideas that the moon acts on the earth and the earth on the moon by introducing the concept of angular momentum transfer in the earth-moon-system. He was followed by G.H. Darwin, the son of the famous biologist. </B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Today, the precise mechanism of energy dissipation is still an open question and, despite a better knowledge of time-scales and sophisticated mathematical modelling techniques, ocean tides are still not known with the desired accuracy. </B><BR>
___________________________________________________________________________________<BR>
<BR>
Science rarely evolves linearly. The path taken by evolution is far from a straight line and, to learn about science, we should focus on its detours! For instance, if we were to take a look at the genealogical tree describing our perceptions of tidal friction <A HREF="#a" NAME="Ra">(a)</A> over time, we could build the following series of aphorisms: <BR>
<BR>
<B><H3>Empirism and theory can originate independently, each unaware of the other.</H3></B>
When, in 1695, Edmund Halley <A HREF="#1" NAME="R1">(1)</A> <A HREF="#2" NAME="R2">(2)</A> noted inconsistencies in how solar eclipses  were interpreted <A HREF="#b" NAME="Rb">(b)</A>, the rotation of the earth was paradigmatic for a constant flow of time. It thus seemed obvious to him to ascribe these inconsistencies to an unexplained peculiarity in the motion of the moon. This was also the explanation that Richard Dunthorne gave in 1748 when he first determined from observation the so-called 'secular acceleration' <A HREF="#c" NAME="Rc">(c)</A> of the lunar orbit: +10<sup>11</sup>/(century)<sup>2</sup> <A HREF="#3" NAME="R3">(3)</A>. <BR>
<BR>
In 1754, however, the young philosopher Immanuel Kant, who took great interest in scientific issues, reasoned on the basis of pure theory that the action of oceanic tides must slow down the earth's rotation <A HREF="#4" NAME="R4">(4)</A> <A HREF="#5" NAME="R5">(5)</A>. His article appeared in a newspaper devoted in large part to advertisements and warrants amidst a windmill sales-ad and a want-ad for peacocks! Kant apparently did not take his ideas on tides very seriously as they have no mention in his "<I>Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels</I>". In fact, they had no immediate impact. It was only in 1867 that his newspaper article was noticed in England and that his contribution was acknowledged retrospectively <A HREF="#6" NAME="R6">(6)</A>. No doubt, if it had been anyone but Kant, the article would have been forgotten. The sad truth is therefore that:<BR>
<BR>
<B><H3>A discovery can be annihilated if it does not enter the scientific consciousness of its time.</H3></B>
At the time, observations on lunar motion were well explained by the prevalent scientific theory, <B>celestial mechanics</B>. In 1786, one of its most respected protagonists, Simon Laplace derived a theoretical acceleration value for the lunar orbit that agreed perfectly with the observed value <A HREF="#7" NAME="R7">(7)</A>. <BR>
<BR>
<B><H3>Nothing is more deadly to an open problem in science than an apparent solution by an acknowledged expert.</H3></B>
Clearly, the matter was settled: "<I>Roma locuta, causa finita"</I> <A HREF="#d" NAME="Rd">(d)</A> and more than one generation had to elapse before the time was ripe for the accepted view to be revised. Adams in 1853 <A HREF="#8" NAME="R8">(8)</A> and Delaunay in 1859 <A HREF="#9" NAME="R9">(9)</A>, working independently, calculated the lunar orbit to a higher level of approximation and showed that Laplace had literally found only half a truth. Half of the peculiarity in the motion of the moon could be interpreted by pure conservative celestial mechanics <A HREF="#e" NAME="Re">(e)</A>, the other half remained unexplained.<BR>
 <BR>
<B><H3>Progress can arise not only from direct revolutionary attacks but also from old facts interpreted anew.</H3></B>
Given that there were two separate lines of thought - the observations relating solely to the moon and Kant's ideas relating solely to the earth - what was needed was a catalyst - not even a theory - to link them. Somebody, somewhere, had to realise that the lunar inequality (apparent acceleration of the moon's motion) might be due not only to the ordinate (the length of the lunar orbit) but also to the abscissa (time). Time was not the uniform time of celestial mechanics equations but was given by the rotating earth. A constant motion measured with a non-uniform time-scale can appear accelerated or decelerated. This simple idea was a 180um. about-turn in Plato's cave and a move out of the shadows into reality. <BR>
<BR>
<B><H3>Much time is often needed to find an 'obvious' truth. When found, its triviality is so embarrassing that people forget who found it. </H3></B>
In this instance, the oblivion is quite surprising as it was Newton's idea that an apparent acceleration of the moon could be due to a change in the rotation of the earth <A HREF="#f" NAME="Re">(f)</A>. The explanation may be that he based his idea on the contested notion of interplanetary vapors which he probably did not fully accept himself as it appears only in the second edition of his '<I>Principia</I>' <A HREF="#10" NAME="R10">(10)</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Julius Robert Mayer <A HREF="#11" NAME="R11">(11)</A> was the first to describe both aspects of the earth-moon interaction in his book "<I>Beitrage zur Dynamik des Himmels</I>" <A HREF="#12" NAME="R12">(12)</A> at a time when celestial mechanics had not yet been revised. While Kant had only seen the <I>actio </I>on the earth, Mayer also saw the <I>reactio</I> on the moon. Mayer's estimates for the rotational energy of the earth had a sound physical basis and were of the same orders of magnitude as those found today. He thought that, for reasons of energy, there had to be observational effects (a shortening of the length of the day) that would decrease the moment of inertia of the Earth and increase its angular velocity. Just think of a skater. This rotating "object" with shrinking extension (moment of inertia) increases its angular velocity for a constant angular momentum. To his mind, the effects passed unnoticed because they were too small to be measured or hidden.<BR>
<BR>
Mayer was an outsider who was finally accepted by the scientific community not for his work on tidal friction but for the theorem of energy conservation. His theorem's application to the earth-moon-system was neglected because, <I>after </I>Adam's revision, in 1879/80, the astronomer G.H. Darwin  produced a full detailed analytical account in the approved insider style <A HREF="#13" NAME="R13">(13)</A> <A HREF="#14" NAME="R14">(14)</A>. Darwin was not fully aware of Mayer's view and, in his popular book on tides <A HREF="#15" NAME="R15">(15)</A>, mistakenly states that Mayer did not consider the reaction on the moon.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, Darwin's analytical treatment does not really further our understanding. The tidal force field of an external body such as the moon on the Earth diminishes the Earth's gravity along the line connecting the centres of these planets and strengthens it at the girdle perpendicular to the first. Darwin painted a picture of a deformable earth with two tidal bulges in the sea surface, one immediately underneath the moon and the other on the opposite side of the globe. This nice phenomenological description can be woven into a consistent theory but its core, i.e. the strength of the interaction between the earth's oceans and the moon (given by the amplitude and phase lag of the tidal bulges), remains a free parameter! <BR>
<B><H3>The richness of a specialist's book can camouflage the crux of the matter.</H3></B>
Not only are the oceans deformed (about 1 cm to 10 metres over 12 hours and 25 minutes) but also the earth (some decimetres). Darwin's description fitted precisely solid earth tides only and this might be why they were temporarily studied in preference to ocean tides. However, the tide phase lag - here of the amplitude of tidal height - had to be measured even for earth tides <A HREF="#g" NAME="Rg">(g)</A>! As long as observations of the moon's position were affected by both the changes in the lunar orbit and the apparent, more dominant, changes due to a non-uniform time-scale, one could not feel comfortable. This discomfort was dissipated when Cowell <A HREF="#16" NAME="R16">(16)</A>, Spencer Jones <A HREF="#17" NAME="R17">(17)</A> and others obtained "unadulterated" <I>pure</I> values for the changes in the earth's rotation from observations of Mercury and the Sun. (The Sun here is just a 180° mirror for the movement of the earth). Because these values for changes in the earth's motion are unaffected by tidal friction, they provide a clean dynamic time-scale <A HREF="#h" NAME="Rh">(h)</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<B><H3>The 'buildings' of science defy the laws of architecture as often built from the roof down.</H3></B>
Recent history has witnessed two major advances that have furthered our knowledge of tidal friction. The first belongs to the realm of 'pure', empirical science. For John Wells <A HREF="#18" NAME="R18">(18)</A> and others, growth rhythms in corals and mussels are produced by the solar day, the synodical <A HREF="#i" NAME="Ri">(i)</A> month and the tropical year. Corals from different periods are a means of measuring frequency and provide the <I>ratios</I> of astronomical periods for time-scales of several 100 million years. George Williams <A HREF="#19" NAME="R19">(19)</A>, in particular, detected tidal variations in Precambrian sediments, thus stretching the time-span of observations into the past. This means of measurement has indicated that the length of the day has changed over millions of years at approximately the same rate as in recent history. The second advance is a technological advance: the advent of large electronic computers. <BR>
<BR>
It is only with current scientific and technological means that oceanic tides, which are geometricallv much more complex than solid earth tides and which are the effects of choice to explain tidal interaction since Kant's day, can be treated in any detail. The average torques between the oceans and the moon for the main partial tides <A HREF="#j" NAME="Rj">(j)</A> calculated with available mathematical models agree with observed values. It thus seems that we have now moved one step up the <I>gradus ad parnassum</I> <A HREF="#k" NAME="Rk">(k)</A>. <BR>
