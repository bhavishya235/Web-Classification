What This Is
<A NAME="What">
</H2>

This is a list, with reviews, of suggested books, periodicals, television shows and 
computer programs for a classroom curriculum or individual study in cybernetics and 
systems theory.  It does not (yet) include a course plan, glossary, or extended 
bibliography.  I was asked to write this by some teachers who received a copy of class 
notes I prepared for a course in "Understanding Whole Systems" sixteen years ago at 
the University of California at Santa Cruz.  They asked how I would revise it based on 
what I know today.  This document answers that question.

Cybernetics and Systems Theory Defined
<A NAME="Defined">
</H2>

Right off, let's dispense with the childish belief that words "have" meanings.  
Charles Dodson / Lewis Carroll was close to the mark with this dialogue between Alice 
and Humpty Dumpty:
<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=+1>
<UL>
        Humpty Dumpty: [Having just proved it is 364 times better to celebrate 
               <UL>
               your un-birthday] There's glory for you!<BR>
               </UL>
        Alice: I don't know what you mean by 'glory.' <BR>
        Humpty Dumpty: Of course you don't -- 'till I tell you.  I meant
               <UL>
               'there's a nice knock-down argument for you!'<BR>
               </UL>
        Alice: But 'glory' doesn't mean 'a nice knock-down argument.'<BR>
        Humpty Dumpty: When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to
               <UL>
               mean -- neither more nor less.<BR>
               </UL>
       Alice: The question is whether you can make words mean so many
               <UL>
               different things.<BR>
               </UL>
        Humpty Dumpty: The question is which is to be the master -- that's all.<BR>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A lot of time has been wasted arguing over what the terms cybernetics and systems 
theory "really" mean.  Rather than add to the muddle, let me just define them, and 
some other related concepts, the way I mean them and leave it at that.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Information is "a difference that makes a difference," to use Gregory Bateson's 
definition.  It is a measure of the reduction of uncertainty (entropy) that results 
from receiving a message.  The term was rigorously defined by Claude Shannon of Bell 
Labs in 1950.  Its unit is the bit, which is the amount by which your uncertainty is 
decreased when you find out that something happened which had a probablity one half.  
The bit measures in units of the minus the log to the base two of probablity: -log2(p)  
By this definiton news that of event which had a probablity of one fourth yields two 
bits of information, news that of event which had a probablity of one eighth yields 
three bits of information, and so on.
<P>
<LI>System is a word that we use to describe any "experience-cluster" that we can map 
as a set of interacting elements over time.  Typically a system is mapped by 
identifying the pathways of information flow -- as well as possibly the flow of 
energy, matter and other variables.  But the "flow" of information is special, because 
only information can go from A to B while also staying at A.  (Consider that photocopy 
machines would be useless if you didn't get to keep your original.)
<P>
<LI>Cybernetics is the study of systems which can be mapped using loops (or more 
complicated looping structures) in the network defining the flow of information.  
Systems of automatic control will of necessity use at least one loop of information 
flow providing feedback.  (Appropriately the word cybernetics is derived from the 
Greek for "pilot," as in "auto pilot" and "pilot light.")  The word was first coined 
in 1945 by Nobert Wiener in the book Cybernetics (listed below), in which he defined 
it as "the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine."  Gregory 
Bateson clarifies the methodology in "Cybernetic Explanation" (one of the essays in 
the book <U>Steps to an Ecology of Mind</U>, listed below.)  In a nutshell, he says:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=+1>
<UL>
Causal explanation is usually positive.  We say that billiard ball B moved
in such and such a direction because billiard ball A hit it at such and such an
angle.  In contrast to this, cybernetic explanation is always negative.  We
consider what alternate possibilites could conceivably have occurred and and
then ask why many of the alternatives were not followed, so that the particular
event was one of the few which could, in fact occur...
<P>
In cybernetic language, the course of events is said to be subject to
restraints, and it is assumed that, apart from such restraints, the pathways of
change would be governed only by equal probability.
</UL>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>Systems theory is the study of systems which can be mapped using any kind of  
network to define the flow of information.  This includes the study of systems 
whose emergent properties we cannot yet predict due to a lack of plausable mechanisms, 
rigorous mapping techniques and/or robust mathematical treatment.

By these definitions systems theory includes and is more abstract than cybernetics.  
In General System Theory (listed below), Ludwig Bertalanffy draws this distinction:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=+1>
<UL>
Cybernetics is a theory of control systems based on communication (transfer of
information) between systems and environment and within the system, and control
(feedback) of the system's function in regard to environment... The model is of
wide application but should not be identified with "systems theory" in general.
<P>
... Cybernetic systems are a special case, however important, of systems
showing self-regulation.
</UL>
</FONT>
<P>
</UL>
Whatever distinctions you draw, what I am aiming at is the study of properties that 
emerge from the interconnectedness and complexity of relationships between parts.


<H2>
Why We Need Cybernetics and Systems Theory Now
<A NAME="Need">
</H2>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=+1>
      "When we try to pick up anything by itself
       we find it is attached to everything in the universe."

                                            -- John Muir </FONT><TT>

</PRE></TT>
I keep having this image of a survey course in human physiology, in which the syllabus 
covers each body system in turn, and in the final week it is all put together into a 
whole person.  But, as the semester drags on the instructor gets behind in the 
material, until suddenly it is time for finals and the integrative material has not 
been covered.  "Well," says the teacher, "I will leave it to the more ambitious 
students as an extra credit project."
<P>
I see this as a metaphor for what is wrong with our educational system, and the body 
of knowledge on which it is based: we have great methods for taking things apart and 
analyzing them, but the problem of putting them back together is trivialized even 
though it is unsolved.  If Western Civilization's science, religion, philosophy and 
epistemology were in better shape (more mature?), we would not need cybernetics and 
systems theory as separate areas of inquiry; they would be woven into the fabric of 
our knowledge as already are other prior mental tools such as: the flexibility of 
language, the rigor of linear algebra, and the etiquette of professional 
communication.  But instead our tradition of education has a blind spot when it comes 
to complexity, interconnectedness and relationship, and properties that emerge from 
them.
<P>
This might all seem like abstraction of abstraction, some kind of "airy fairy" 
diversion of language, except that the results are vital to questions of survival.  As 
columnist Ellen Goodman pointed out about health research (LA Times 5/26/87): "There's 
a tendency to study single diseases and small body parts instead of lives.  The group 
concerned with the maintenance of lungs doesn't always 'do' ankles and the cancer-
prevention team isn't 'into' cardiovascular diseases.  As the last generalists, we, 
the owners of whole bodies, are supposed to think of ourselves as nothing more than 
the sum of parts and potential diseases to be taken care of with separate regimens."
[Emphasis mine.]  Or, as a Buddhist baker once said, "We're all in this alone."  We 
each face the integration of life, the universe and everything with few really useful 
clues from our mainstream culture and educational systems.
<P>
The blind spot in our civilization when it comes to wholeness and loops goes back a 
long way.  Plato said, in Georgics, that "Helmsmanship is unassuming and modest and 
does not boast and does not behave as if it had done something wonderful."  This 
contempt for piloting fits in with the general ancient Greek aversion to any linking 
truth-seeking with useful activity.  This meant the literate philosophers and the 
skilled workers were kept apart.  The Romans were by contrast ruthlessly practical, 
had literate engineers (who could write down their skills and plans).  They conquered 
the known world with their "practicality," which had toxic social, religious and 
ecological side effects.  Christinanity swept the Roman empire partially as an 
antidote to the Roman toxic pragmatism.  The dark ages were, in Europe, a period of 
avoidance of practical applications of technology in favor of the search for religious 
grace.  Our civilization didn't deviate from this pattern until the 13th Century, when 
literate monks were forced to garden, and dragged out a bunch of Roman engineering 
books, rediscovering hydraulics and inventing the windmill.  Similar integrations of 
learning and labor helped bring about the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution.  
And yet today we call schools where more practical skills are taught "Junior 
Colleges," while all the really useless ideas are confined to "Universities."  Greek 
logic was made symbolic by nineteenth century academic George Boole, who -- like the 
Greeks -- prohibited loops in logic chains.  But in this century electronic engineers 
found that you can build logic gates physically, and you can hook them up in loops, 
resulting in both digital memories and digital oscillators.  These humble engineers 
were "off the map" of Western civilization's mathematics and philosophy.  One of the 
simplest of these circuits was a one-bit memory, which was named a "flip flop" -- 
indicating the lack of academic tradition for the whole idea.
<P>
Our traditions cling to the idea that explanations can be built of short causal 
chains: event A causes event B, which causes event C.  Loops are prohibited because 
they are hard to analyze, introducing non-linear terms into the equations.  Therefore 
our current scientific method has become a form of pretend madness in which we deny 
that anything is connected to anything else unless we can prove that it is.  We use 
this method because we can so much more easily start with assumed isolation and then 
prove the connectedness of the components of a system than do the opposite.  But our 
simplifying assumption has become an article of faith, and this false faith is 
aggravating the "externalities" of our society: pollution, crime, alienation, 
illiteracy, the decay of our infrastructure, the decline of our industry.  All of 
these problems have been amplified by the success of our technology in achieving 
narrowly defined goals.  Cybernetics and systems theory are part of the antidote to 
the toxic byproducts of our short-sighted reductionism.

Where Cybernetics and Systems Theory Came From
<A NAME="From">
</H2>
<PRE><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=+1>
"What is a man, that he may know a number,
or a number, that a man may know it?"

                                        -- Warren McCulloch </FONT><TT>
</PRE></TT>
In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell (author Maxwell's equations of the electrodynamics, and 
inventor of the mental construct Maxwell's Demon) was invited by steam engineers to 
help them figure out why the governors on their engines didn't always work right: 
sometimes the steam engines exploded.  Maxwell analyzed the "steam-engine-with-
governor under a changing load" as a system of non-linear differential equations, and 
concluded the system would do one of five things based on the coefficients of the 
equations.  (1) It corrected the speed back to the desired level fairly smoothly (the 
most desired response):
<BR>
<IMG SRC="HIP/governor0.gif" ALT="damped" ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
Or (2) it corrected the speed back to the desired level after some overshoot (also a 
desired response):
<BR>
<IMG SRC="HIP/governor2.gif" ALT="damped oscillation" ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
Or (3) it oscillated continuously -- an annoying and inefficient repsonse later called 
"hunting" in the 1930's by electronics researches (actually this behavior was not 
explicitly described by Maxwell, probably because it is unstable, but it is implicit 
in his analysis):
<BR>
<IMG SRC="HIP/governor3.gif" ALT="oscillation" ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
Or (4) it oscillated with increasing amplitude until it blew up (also sometimes called 
"hunting":
<BR>
<IMG SRC="HIP/governor4.gif" ALT="hunting" ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
Or (5) it just blew up:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="HIP/governor1.gif" ALT="explosion" ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
This was the first explicitly cybernetic analysis of a system I can find.  Thanks to 
it the engineers were able to design their governors so that the steam engines didn't 
explode so often.  The governor became a metaphor for some 19th century visionaries: 
Samuel Butler in Erewhon predicted thinking machines evolving out of governors, and 
Alfred Russell Wallace came up with the idea of evolution by natural selection -- 
independently from Darwin -- when he realized that adaptive restraints operated like a 
governor on a steam engine.
<P>
By the 1930's, when electronics was still young, electrical network theory had 
developed, and the select few who studied it began to understand self-correcting 
systems.  Doctors also tended to gain this intuition, and in 1932 physician Walter 
Cannon in The Wisdom of the Body coined the term homeostasis to describe this 
phenomenon.
<P>
By the late 1940's, thanks mostly to the growth of electronics, a lot of people were 
running around with the idea that "feedback" was somehow important.  One of them was 
<A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cloder/cshonor/">Warren McCulloch</A>, a pioneer brain researcher who first proposed the mathematical 
modeling of neurons.  He was approached by the Macy Foundation to chair a conference 
on the nervous system.  The Macy Foundation, funded by the family that ran Macy's 
department store (and its famous Thanksgiving Day parade), funded conferences on 
medicine; they had done the heart, lungs, skin, etc. but never the brain or nerves.  
But McCulloch was determined to make these meetings more than a typical medical 
conference.  He invited physiologists, electronics specialists, mathematicians, 
physicists, even social scientists -- including husband and wife anthropologists 
Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead.  The participants met for a few days every six 
months over a period of several years.  At first McCulloch only let the "neuro" people 
talk; he wanted everyone to understand the great questions facing them before they 
started looking for answers.  But eventually a cautious collaboration developed, as 
the participants probed their intuition of what was missing from their knowledge of 
minds.
<P>
In 1948 one of the attendees, mathemetician Norbert Wiener, published a book in which 
he purported to name the new field of inquiry they were investigating: Cybernetics was 
the name of the field and the book.  This move received mixed reviews from the other 
participants in the conference.  However, many of the attendees did return to their 
disciplines and begin using the new set of tools provided by the conference, and by 
Wiener (including two who I had the good fortune to meet and study under: Gregory 
Bateson and Heinz von Foerster).
<P>
Meanwhile, in Germany, Ludwig von Bertalanffy began publishing papers on the theory of 
general systems, in which he (prophetically in many cases) laid down some of the 
criteria of such a theory.  He pointed out that the fundamental tool of general 
systems theory was the system of differential equations, but any such set of equations 
robust enough to describe non-trivial systems was unsolvable.  Therefore, intuition 
and computer simulation should play important roles in a theory of complex systems.  
But his work had little impact initially.
<P>
In 1950 Shannon and Weaver at Bell Labs published their first paper on what has been 
called "information theory" and "communication theory," but I would prefer to call 
"transmission theory."  It is the study of how to get bits reliably over an unreliable 
channel -- a topic of great interest to Bell Telephone at that time.  In academia this 
work eclipsed cybernetics, probably because it was less intellectually threatening; 
cybernetics advocated connecting outputs to inputs, which had been forbidden since the 
ancient Greeks, while information theory dealt with the familar model of:
<PRE><TT>
                    +-------+     +---------+     +--------+
                    | INPUT |---->| PROCESS |---->| OUTPUT |
                    +-------+     +---------+     +--------+
</PRE></TT>

Also, it didn't help that the popular press picked up and began to abuse the word 
"cybernetics," as if it meant "the study of computers, robots, and electronic gizmos," 
or that the book Psycho-Cybernetics was published by plastic surgeon Maxwell Maltz in 
1960; it was a useful pop-psychology self-help book about auto-suggestion, but had 
little to do with cybernetics.
<P>
With the advance of digital computers in the 50's and 60's, the field of "information 
science" was heralded, which included the study of computer languages and their 
compilers, as well as Shannon's work.  But cybernetics mostly suffered benign neglect 
by information science departments.  By way of an example, in 1966 Scientific American 
published an entire issue devoted to the new technology of information, and later re-
issued it as one of their theme paperbacks, called Information.  Every diagram in this 
book has the same structure as the one above: INPUT, PROCESS, OUTPUT.
<P>
Yet, while the so-called information scientists ignored cybernetics (which they could 
because they designed systems and were free to design them without feedback), those 
scientists investigating the biochemistry of cell metabolism, the principles of 
nervous systems, and the population biology of ecologies (all pre-existing systems) 
were drawn to cybernetics because it offered more accurate models of the systems they 
were studying.
<P>
Some progress was made by topologists in the late 60's in classifying systems in terms 
of all possible behaviors they could exhibit.  Initially this work, called the theory 
of dynamical systems, simply refined the distinctions drawn by Maxwell's governor 
paper.
<P>
The biggest methodological barrier to the advance of cybernetics in the 50's and 60's 
was the expense of computer time.  But in the 70's pocket calculators became 
affordable, and it was on such a calculator that some of the earliest examples of 
chaos were discovered.  This term is not used here in the every-day sense, but to 
describe a fifth category of system behavior besides the four illustrated above: non-
periodic deterministic behavior.  The discoveries of chaos, along with increasingly 
available computer power, sparked a renaissance of interest in cybernetics and systems 
theory in the late 80's.
<P>
Won't it be exciting to see what the 90's will bring?

How I Got Into Cybernetics and Systems Theory
<A NAME="How">

"Watch out -- you might get what you're after."

                                  -- David Byrne, 1983

In the fall of 1969, while a Junior in high school in southern California, I got my 
hands on an early Whole Earth Catalog.  I was attracted to it because the title 
sounded integrative, and sure enough the first section was entitled Understanding 
Whole Systems.  Here I was exposed to the ideas of Bucky Fuller, Norbert Wiener, 
Marshall McLuhan, and Paul Ehrlich.  I went to a college where I could design my own 
major program (University of California at Santa Cruz, Kresge Collge), and searched 
for three years for a faculty member who would sponsor my major in "Understanding 
Whole Systems."  Dr. Gregory Bateson arrived at Kresge in the fall of 1973, and I had 
even studied his English accent for a school play, but it wasn't until he was featured 
on the first page of the Understanding Whole Systems section of the new Whole Earth 
Epilog in summer of 1974 that I realized he was who I had been looking for.  Starting 
in my senior year I took all of his classes, and he sponsored a student-directed 
seminar which I taught in early 1975 on Understanding Whole Systems.  I'd planned to 
extend this activity into my major program, but I too quickly reached the end of my 
senior year, I hadn't met the university breadth requirements to graduate, and I was 
out of scholarship money.
<P>
Also in my senior year I met Dixie.  We dropped out of school and bicycled across 
America together in 1976-77.  On this journey I discovered that poverty was a real 
danger in an unplanned life -- a lesson that had escaped me both while growing up in 
suburbia and while attending a Liberal Arts university --  so upon our return from 
this trip I earned money and got a new scholarship so I could go back to school.  I 
proposed marriage to Dixie, and I switched my major to Information Sciences in hopes 
of being more employable.  Sure enough, after six months of school in 1977, at the 
dawn of the Personal Computer revolution I got my first job in computers, even though 
I had not studied Info Sci long enough to get a degree.  We wed and moved from 
northern California to Massachusetts.
<P>
For a decade I rode the computer wave, letting my interest in whole systems be a hobby 
on my back burner.  About the only thing I did to keep this interest alive to was to 
occasionally visit libraries on the Dewey Decimal System and scan the shelf that 
started with 000.  This is where all the books on cybernetics, systems theory, theory 
of knowledge, philosophy of science, library science, management science, ESP, flying 
saucers, witchcraft and Atlantis may be found.
<P>
By 1987 I was a computer graphics programmer for the NASA Space Station project at 
Rockwell International in southern California, which was exciting work until Rockwell 
lost the Space Station contract.  In casting about for a new challenge I fell into 
working for a company (currently named Stardent Computer Inc.) which manufactures 
Graphics Supercomputers.  Now it so happens that the users of these kind of computers 
are people who need extremely high-speed computation combined with interactive 
graphics, and most people who fit that description are doing scientific research using 
a new methodogy called numerical simulation.  And this methodology is on the 
forefront of systems theory.  So I find that I am reaping the dual bonus that my hobby 
is useful in my job, and my job gives me opportunities to expand my understanding of 
my hobby.
<P>
As I explained above, some teachers recently received, through a mutual friend, a copy 
of my class handouts from that course in "Understanding Whole Systems" which Bateson 
sponsored me in teaching sixteen years ago at <A HREF="http://www.ucsc.edu/index.html">the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC)</A>.  They asked how I would revise 
those notes based on what I have learned in the intervening years.  I am happy to 
answer that question.

Stewart Brand was running around in the mid-sixties (when NASA had taken its
first satellite photos of the earth with the entire round profile in the frame
but wouldn't release them to the public), handing out protest buttons which
said, "WHY HAVEN'T WE SEEN THE WHOLE EARTH?"  And sure enough, when detailed
color pictures taken by the Apollo Eight crew of our home planet were published
right after Christmas 1968, they galvanized the public and helped in the
popularization of the ecology movement.  As Joni Mitchell sang:
<UL><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=+1>
"In a highway service station, over the month of June,<BR>
Was a photograph of the Earth taken coming back from the Moon.<BR>
And you couldn't see a city on that marble bowling ball,<BR>
Or a forest or a highway, or me the least of all." </FONT><BR>
</UL>
It was this type of romanticization of the Whole Earth which lead me to the
Whole Earth Catalog.  Actually, the WEC (as it calls itself) began as a mail-
order catalog for back-to-the-land communes, but it had an eccelctic, holistic
view that quickly took it into cybernetcis and systems theory, and I followed.
As I explained in the introduction, these "catalogs" edited by Stewart Brand
first introduced me to most of the ideas and thinkers listed in this essay.

<I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1>The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG got started in a plane over Nebraska in March 1968.  I 
was returning to California from my father's long dying and funeral that 
morning in Illinois.  The sun had set ahead of the plane while I read Spaceship 
Earth by Barbara Ward.  Between chapters I gazed out the window into dark 
nothing and slid into a reverie about my friends who were starting their own 
civilization hither and yon in the sticks and how could I help.  The L. L. Bean 
catalog of outdoor stuff came to mind and I pondered upon Mr. Bean's service to 
humanity over the years.  So many of the problems I could identify came down to 
a matter of access.  Where to buy a windmill.  Where to get good information 
about bee-keeping.  Where to lay hands on a computer without forfeiting 
freedom...
<P>
Shortly I was fantasizing access service.  A Truck Store, maybe, travelling 
around with information and samples of what was worth getting and information 
where to get it.  A Catalog too, continuously updated, in part by the users.  A 
Catalog that owed nothing to the suppliers and everything to the users.  It 
would be something I could put some years into.
<P>
Amid the fever I was in by this time, I remembered Fuller's admonition that you 
have about 10 minutes to act on an idea before it recedes back into dreamland.  
I started writing on the end papers of Barbara Ward's book (never did finish 
reading it).
<P>

<P>
Understanding whole systems is knowing how to fly.  You can rise above local 
circumstances, travel with blurring speed, and set down in a place wholly 
distant, strange and wonderful.  Or maybe not so wonderful, in which case you 
best know how to take off in a tight situation, and remember where home is.
<P>
The price you pay for understanding is the grim knowledge of trade-offs in 
design.  That you can have an airplane that goes fast or one that lands in 200 
ft., but not both.  That to save these people you may have to starve those 
people.
<P>
By and by you dwell in a wilderness of conflicting considerations.  If you
survive your wishful solutions -- and there's usually margin -- you may become
a wily and sky-hooked metaphysician.  The solutions are always meta.  The means
always funky field expedient.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
Evolution and cybernetics are going to come together.  This is the edge of 
knowledge right now, and it's right at the heart of education, and the schools 
don't know it.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1>In getting my mind ready to study systems of all types, I find it useful to 
zoom through the universe looking at all size scales.  This is an old idea; as

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1>Two pieces in one book: The first, "Both Sides of the Necessary Paradox," an 
interview with Bateson that probes well into the man's ideas about 
metacommunication and his metacommunication about ideas.  This is the 
article that got me motivated enough to read <I>Steps to an Ecology of Mind</I>.
<P>
The second piece is "Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums," a 
look at the "outlaw" origins of interactive computer (video) games, written 
at a moment in history when we didn't all know they were coming.  The failure 
of "information science" to predict the important changes in computing comes 
from the lack of cybernetic awareness which leads to drawing a box around the 
computer excluding the human.  Only with the programmer/operator "in the loop" 
do the magical effects of computers appear.

If Spinoza was right when he said in De Emendatione that "the greatest good is
the knowledge of the union which the mind has with the whole of nature," then
this is a great book indeed.
<P>
Thinking he had a year to live (incorrectly as it turned out) Bateson condensed
all the non-trivial things he knew into a book for laypersons.  The bottom
line: minds in organisms and ecologies are simularly organized, using
digital internal reshuffling followed by analog natural selection involving
an interface to an environment to achieve "mental" effects.

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=+1><I>
In June 1977, I thought I had the beginnings of two books.  One I called
The Evolutionary Idea and the other Every Schoolboy Knows<SUPER>*</SUPER>.  The first was to
be an attempt to reexamine the theories of biological evolution in the light of
cybernetics and information theory.  But as I began to write that book, I found
it difficult to write with a real audience in mind who, I could hope, would
understand the formal and therefore simple presuppositions of what I was
saying.  It became monstrously evident that the schooling in this country [USA]
and in England and, I suppose, in the entire Occident was so careful to avoid
all crucial issues that I would have to write a second book to explain what
seemed to me elementary ideas relevant to evolution and to almost any other
biological or social thinking -- to daily life and to the eating of breakfast.
Official education was telling people almost nothing of the nature of all those
things on the seashores and in the redwood forests, in the deserts and the
plains.  Even grown-up persons with children of their own cannot give a
reasonable account of concepts such as entropy, sacrament, syntax, number,
quantity, pattern, linear relation, name, class, relevance, energy, redundancy,
force, probability, parts, whole, information, tautology, homolgy, mass (either
Newtonian or Christian), explanation, rule of dimensions, logical type,
metaphor, topology, and so on.  What are butterflies?  What are starfish?  What
are beauty and ugliness?
<P>
It seemed to me that the writing out of some of these very elementary ideas
could be entitled, with a little irony, "Every Schoolboy Knows."
<P>
But as I sat in Lindisfarne working on these two manuscripts, sometimes adding
a piece to one and sometimes a piece to the other, the two gradually came
together, and the product of that coming together is what I think is called a
Platonic view.  It seemed to me that in "Schoolboy," I was laying down very
elementary ideas about epistemology, about how we can know anything.  In the
pronoun we I of course included the starfish and the redwood forest, the
segmenting egg, and the Senate of the United States.
<P>
And in the anything which these creatures variously know, I included "how to
grow into five-way symmetry," "how to survive a forest fire," "how to grow and
still stay the same shape," "how to learn," "how to write a constitution," "how
to to invent and drive a car," "how to count to seven," and so on.  Marvelous
creatures with almost miraculous knowledges and skills.
<P>
Above all I included "how to evolve," because it seemed to me that both
evolution and learning must fit the same formal regularities or so-called laws.
I was, you see, starting to use the ideas of "Schoolboy" to reflect, not on our
own knowing, but on the wider knowing which is the glue holding together the
starfishes and sea anemones and redwood forests and human committees.
<P>
My two manuscripts were becoming a single book because there is a single
knowing which characterizes evolution as well as aggregates of humans, even
though committees and nations may seem stupid to two-legged geniuses like you
and me.
<P>
I was transcending that line which is sometimes supposed to enclose the human
being.  In other words, mind became, for me, a reflection of large parts and
many parts of the natural world outside the thinker.
<P>

A collection of a life's work of interdisciplinary thinking that grew more
cybernetic over the years.  On the first page of the "Understanding Whole
Systems" section of the <I>Whole Earth Epilog</I> in 1974, Stewart Brand had this to
say about this book:
<P>	
<UL><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE=+1>
Where the insights of Buckminster Fuller initiated the <I>Whole Earth
Catalog</I> [in 1968], Gregory Bateson's insights lurk behind most of what's
going on in this Epilog.
<P>
Through him I became convinced that much more of whole systems could be
understood than I thought -- that mysticism, mood, ignorance and paradox
could be rigorous, for instance, and that the most potent tool for
grasping these essences -- these influnece nets -- is cybernetics.
<P>
Bateson is responsible for a number of formal discoveries, most notably
the "Double Bind" theory of schizophrenia.  As an anthropologist he did
pioneer work in New Guinea and (with Margaret Mead) in Bali.  He
participated in the Macy Foundation meetings that founded the science of
cybernetics but kept a healthy distance from computers.  He has wandered
thornily in and out of various disciplines -- biology, ethnology,
linguistics, epistemology, psychotherapy -- and left each of them
altered with his passage.
<P>
This book chronicles the journey.  It is a collection of all his major
papers, 1935 - 1971.  In recommending the book I've learned to suggest
that it be read backwards.  Read the recent broad analyses of mind and
ecology at the end of the book and then work back to see where the
premises come from.
<P>
In my view Bateson's special contribution to cybernetics is in exploring
its second, more difficult realm (where the first is feedback, a process
influencing itself, which Bateson calls 'circuit'; and the second is the
meta-realm of hierarchic levels, the domain of context, of paradox and
abundant pathology, and of learning.)
<P>
Strong medicine.

In no system which shows mental characteristics can any part have unilateral
control over the whole.  In other words, the mental characteristics of the
system are immanent, not in some part, but in the system as a whole.

The social scene is nowadays characterized by the existence of a large number
of self-maximizing entities which, in law, have something like the status of
'persons' -- trusts, companies, political parties, unions, commercial and
financial agencies, nations, and the like.  In biological fact, these entities
are precisely not persons and are not even aggregates of whole persons.  They
are aggregates of parts of persons.

When your cat is trying to tell you to give her food, how does she do it?  She
has no word for food or milk.  What she does is to make movements and sounds
that are characteristically those that a kitten makes to a mother cat.  If we
were to translate the cat's message into words, it would not be correct to say
that she is crying 'Milk!'  Rather, she is saying something ike 'Mama!'  Or,
perhaps still more correctly, we should say that she is asserting 'Dependency!
Dependency!'  The cat talks in terms of patterns and contingencies of
relationship, and from this talk it is up to you to take a deductive step,
guessing that it is milk that the cat wants.

Evolution has long been badly taught.  In particular, students -- and even
professional biologists -- acquire theories of evolution without any deep
understanding of what problem these theories attempt to solve.  They
learn but little of the evolution of evolutionary theory.

The development of life on earth must thus not be seen as something remarkable.
On the contrary, it was inevitable.  It was inevitable in the sense that if a 
system as large as the surface of the earth, basically polystable, is kept 
gently simmering dynamically for five thousand million years, then nothing 
short of a miracle could keep the system away from those states in which the 
variables are aggregated into intensely self-preserving forms.

This book forms an introduction to the common ground of brains, machines, and
mathematics, where mathematics is used to exploit analogies between the working
of brains and the control-computation-communication aspects of machines.  It is
designed for a reader who has heard of currently fashionable topics such as
cybernetics, information theory, and Godel's theorem and wants to gain from one
source more of an understanding of them than is afforded by popularizations.
Here the reader will find not only what certain results are, but also why.  The
number of pages has been kept deliberately small </I>[about 160]<I> so that a first
reading is feasable in an evening or two.  Yet a lot of ground is covered, and
the reader who wants to go further should find himself reasonably well prepared
to tackle the technical literature.  Full use of the book does require a
moderate mathematical background -- a year of college calculus (or the
equivalent "mathematical maturity").  However, much of the book should be
intelligible to the reader who chooses to skip the mathematical proofs, and no
previous study of biology or computers is required at all.</I> [p. vii]

Heinz Von Foerster was a co-founder of cybernetics, and he retired near where I 
went to college, so I got to meet him a few times (his wife made great 
strudel), but what I really got a lot out of was sitting in Bateson's office 
thumbing through this book Heinz put together as a year long class project 
('73-'74) at the Biological Computer Lab at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana, taking notes longhand becasue the book wasn't loaned out.  Included are 
definitons of key concepts by Ross Ashby, Gregory Bateson, Stafford Beer, 
Stewart Brand, Jurgen Habermas, Garrett Hardin, Ivan Illich, John Lilly, 
Humberto Maturana, Warren McCulloch, Gordon Pask, Bill Powers, G. Spencer-
Brown, Francisco Valera, Heinz Von Foerster and Norbert Wiener.  A new edition 
was brought out by the Cybernetic Systems Program at SJSU in '86.

FEEDBACK
<P>
The return of part of a system's output to change its input.  Positive feedback
increases the input, negative feedback decreases it.  Hence if feedback is used
(as it is in all regulatory systems) in comparing output with some standard to
be approached, negative feedback is inherently stabilizing (because it
decreases the error) while positive feedback is inherently de-stabilizing (and
the error gains explosively in magnitude).  The casual use of 'feedback' to
mean 'response to a stimulus' is incorrect.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
An unpoetic inexpressive word that shrieks for replacement.  Correct use of the
word would refer to eating your own vomit.  'Positive'or 'negative' feedback
would signify whether you like the vomit or not.  I'd prefer a term like
'circuit' to indicate any system or subsystem that responds to its own action
-- and something like 'convergent' or 'divergent' to indicate the nature of
response ('divergent' would cover the two unstable forms -- anti-corrective
'positive feedback' and over-corrective hunting oscillation.)

There are those who are skeptical as to the precise identity between entropy
and biological disorganization.  It will be necessary for me to evaluate these
criticisms sooner ot later, but for the present I must assume that the
differences lie, not in the fundamental nature of these quantities, but in the
systems in which they are observed.  It is too much to expect a final,
clear-cut definition of entropy on which all writers will agree in any less
than the closed, isolated system.</I> [p. 21]

The problem here is that Wiener was a mathematical prodigy and he had no 
patience for people who couldn't instantly follow his symbology.  This means 
that you aren't warned what the prerequisites are for this book, and there 
isn't enough context for his equations.  Still, this was the seminal book on 
cybernetics, so I have to mention it.  Wiener's emphasis was on function 
prediction and statistics; this was his background, and he had designed
self-aiming anti-aircraft guns in World War II, which predicted an aircraft's
future path based on its previous positions.

When I came to M.I.T. around 1920, the general mode of putting the questions
concerning non-linear apparatus was to look for a direct extension of the
notion of impedance which would cover linear as well as non-linear systems.
The result was that the study of non-linear electrical engineering was getting
into a state comparable with that of the last stages of the Ptolemaic system of
astronomy, in which epicycle was piled on epicycle, correction upon correction,
until a vast patchwork structure ultimately broke down under its own weight.

hope that by rubbing elbows with those great atomic physicists and

revealed that in any living system there are more than two electrons, the 
physicists would not speak to me.  With all their computers they could not say 
what the third electron might do.  The remarkable thing is that it knows 
exactly what to do.  So that little electron knows something that all the wise 
men of Princeton don't, and this can only be something very simple.

applies a set of instructions to a piece of material, and a pattern thereby 
becomes visible.

What if we had applied the same instructions to a segment of manila roap 
instead?  Or a shoelace?  Or even a piece of cooked spaghetti?  We would still 
create an overhand knot...  The knot isn't that little bundle that we can see

A holographic stream-of-consciousness blend of the true history of the 
struggle to control technology combined with a prescription for individual 
action to make the world work.  Stewart Brand had this to say about Bucky 
on the first page of the "Understanding Whole Systems" section of the <I>Last Whole 
Earth Catalog</I>:
<P>
<UL>
The insights of Buckminister Fuller initiated this catalog. ... People 
who beef about Fuller mainly complain about his repetition -- the same 
ideas again and again, it's embarassing, also illuminating, because the 
same notions take on different contexts.  Fuller's lectures have a raga 
quality of rich nonlinear endless improvisations full of convergent 
surprises.
<P>
Some are put off by his language, which makes demands on your head like 
suddenly dicovering an extra engine in your car -- if you don't let it 
drive you faster, it'll drag you.  Fuller won't wait.  He spent two 
years silent after illusory language got him in trouble, and he returned 
to human communication with a redesigned instrument. 
</UL>
<P>
Fuller said that as a result of his Navy experiences, he would rather be not 
understood than misuderstood.  Plenty of both do occur, unfortunately, and the 
irony is that so many of the Bucky groupies I met at <A HREF="http://www.libertynet.org:80/~wgi/">World Game</A> events and such 
completely misunderstood his ideas.  Be warned.  Yet the best way to access his 
ideas is not through his writings, but through audio and videotapes of his 
talks.  There he made his expression of his ideas the simplest.

it" economically on this planet and in the Universe.  We do.  It can only be 
accomplished, however, through a design science initiative and technological 
revolution.
<P>
For three-quarters of all the trillions of nights that humans have been on 
board planet Earth, the Moon has been their most intimate sky companion.  For 
millions of years humans assumed it to be obvious that no one would really 
touch the Moon.  Those who did not assume that to be obvious were obviously 
loony -- lunatics, "Moon touchers."
<P>
In the battle for human power systems to see who is to control the world's 
people and their economies, the communist U.S.S.R. and the capitalist U.S.A. 
had been taught by World War II that whoever could fly the highest would gain 
the observational advantage for controlling the firepower of their guns and 
thus win the military supremacy of the world.  In the "cold" Third World War 
the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A., inspired by the German rocketry, saw that whoever 
could maintain the most around-the-world-outer-space-platforms could control 
around-the-world-firepower.  The Moon was just such a "permanent" sky 
advantage.
<P>
Greatly challenged by the Russian's initially most successful space-operating 
accomplishments, President John Kennedy authorized the funds for the Apollo 
Project, which had first to do all of the tasks here on Earth preparatory to 
getting a team of humans ferried over to the Moon, to land, and then to return 
safely to Earth.
<P>
There were obvious first things first to be accomplished -- second things 
before third things and 7308 things before 7309 things.  Some were going to 
take longer than others.  There would be a pattern of start-ups and lead-ins of 
differing time lengths.  This complex, shad-bone-like pattern would be known as 
"the critical path."  The critical path of overall human history's 
technological evolution involved [approximately] two million things that had to 
be done before blast-off of the first Earth-to-Moon ferrying-over-and-back....
<P>
Now, in 1980, a large number of humans ten years of age and under, all of whom 
were born after humans reached the Moon, have learned so much about the Apollo 
Project as to be quite familiar with its critical path accomplishment.  They 
have entered the evolutionary scenario at a spontaneous conceptual level twice 
as well informed as initially as were any pre-Apollo Project humans....  The 
under-ten-year-old post-Moon-landers are saying, "Humans can do anything they 
need to do."  They are writing me letters saying so and asking why we don't 
make our world work satisfactorily for all humans.  This is encouraging.
<P>
By 1989 those successful Moon-ferry-over conditioned, thoughtful young ones 
will be twenty.  That's just the right age for commanding and executing the 
1989 world-embracing design science revolution, which will result in the 
conversion of humanity into an integrated, omniharmonious, economically 
successful, one-world family.

...all mathematical derivation can be viewed as change in representation,
making evident what was previously true but obscure.  This view can be extended
to all of problem solving -- solving a problem simply means representing it so
as to make the solution transparent.  If the problem solving could actually be
organized in these terms, the issue of representation would indeed become
central.

Someone once asked Werner Erhardt, of "The est Training" fame, how people get 
into behavior traps.  He said, "You don't find them; they find you."  This 
answer shows an awareness of elementray memetics, the theory of self-replicating messages.  Before the word was coined, Dr. Eric Berne was using an 
awareness of its principles to analyize behavior traps, using the methods of 
Transactional Analysis, which he founded.  (He first described it in the book 
Games People Play, and others went on to promote it in I'm OK, You're OK.).
<P>
Do be aware: Grinder and Bandler (below) say that the Parent-Adult-Child (PAC) 
parts of the mind described by Berne are not really there until the patient is 
taught Transactional Analysis; they form just another "script," albeit one with 
useful handles for the therapist to grab onto.

Life-script scenes have to be set up and motivated ahead of time, just like 
theatrical scenes.  A simple example is running out of gas.  It is nearly 
always set up two or three days in advance by looking at the gauge, "planning" 
to get gas "some time soon," and then not doing it.  In fact it is impossible 
to run out of gas "right now" except in a strange car with a broken gauge.  
Many winners go through a whole lifetime without running dry.
<P>
Life scripts are based on parental programming, which the child seeks out for 
three reasons.  (1) It gives a purpose to life where it might otherwise be 
wanting.  A child does most things for the sake of people, usually his parents.  
(2) It gives him an acceptable way to structure time (acceptable, that is, to 
his parents). (3) People have to be told how to do things.  Learning for 
oneself may be inspiring, but it is not very practical.  A man does not become 
a good pilot by wrecking a few airplanes and learning from his errors.  He has 
to learn through other people's failures, not his own....  So parents program 
their children by passing on to them what they have learned, or what they think 
they have learned.  If they are losers, they will pass on their loser's 
programming, and if they are winners, they will pass on that kind of program.  
The long term always has a story line.

There are several important ways in which what we do differs radically from 
others who do workshops on communication or psychotherapy.  When we first 
started in the field, we would watch brilliant people do interesting things and 
then afterwards they would tell various particular metaphors that they called 
theorizing.  They would tell stories about millions of holes, or about 
plumbing: that you have to understand that people are just a circle with pipes 
coming from every direction, and all you need is Drano or something like that.  
Most of these metaphors weren't very useful in helping people learn 
specifically what to do or how to do it....
<P>
There's also a group of people who are called theoreticians.  They will tell 
you what their beliefs are about the true nature of humans and what the 
completely "transparent, adjusted, genuine, authentic," etc. person should be, 
but they don't show you how to do anything.
<P>
Most knowledge in the field of psychology is organized in ways that mix 
together what we call "modeling" -- what traditionally has been called 
"theorizing" -- and what we consider theology.  The descriptions of what people 
do have been mixed together with descriptions of what really "is."  When you 
mix experience together with theories and wrap them all up in a package, that's 
a psychotheology.  What has developed in psychology is different religious 
belief systems with very powerful evangelists working from all of these 
differing orientations.
<P>
Another strange thing about psychology is that there's a whole body of people 
called "researchers" who will not associate with the people who are practicing.  
Somehow the field of psychology got divided up so that the researchers no 
longer provide information for, and respond to, the practitioners in the field.  
In medicine, the people doing research are trying to find things to help the 
practitioners in the field.  And the practitioners respond to the researchers, 
telling them what they need to know more about.

is no go.  I cannot think of it this way.  It is too big, too complex, with too
many working parts lacking visible connections.  The other night, driving
through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this.
If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like?  Then,

Item.  A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities.  We are not
made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own
parts.  We are shared, rented, occupied.  At the interior of our cells, driving
them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of
each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not
ours.  They turn out to be little seperate creatures, the colonial posterity of
migrant prokaryocytes, probably primitve bacteria that swam into ancestral
precursors and stayed there.  Ever since, they have maintained themselves and
their ways, replicating in their own fashion, with their own DNA and RNA
different from ours.</I> [p. 2]

So far as modern science is concerned, we have to abandon completely the idea 
that by going into the realm of the small we shall reach the ultimate 
foundations of the universe.  I believe we can abandon this idea without any 
regret.  The universe is infinite in all directions, not only above us in the 
large but also below us in the small.  If we start from our human scale of 
existence and explore the content of the universe further and further, we 
finally arrive, both in the large and in the small, at misty distances where 
first our senses and then even our concepts fail us.

Let us summarize the story up to this point.  Our illustrious predecessor Erwin 
Schrodinger gave his book the title What Is Life? but neglected to ask whether 
the two functions of life, metabolism and replication, are separable or 
inseparable.  Our illustrious predecessor John von Neumann raised the question 
which Schrodinger had missed and gave it a provisional answer.  Von Neumann 
observed that metabolism and replication, however intricately they may be 
linked in the biological world as it now exists, are logically separable.  It 
is logically possible to postulate organisms composed of pure hardware, capable 
of metabolism but incapable of replication.  It is possible to postulate 
organisms composed of pure software, capable of replication but incapable of 
metabolism.  And if the functions of life are separated in this fashion, it is 
to be expected that the latter type of organism will become an obligitory 
parasite upon the former.

On December 29, 1959, Richard Feynman (now a Nobel laureate) gave a talk at an 
annual meeting of the American Physical Society entitled "There's Always Room 
at the Bottom."  He described a non-biochemical approach to nanomachinery 
(working down, step by step, using larger machines to build smaller machines), 
and stated that the principles of physics "do not speak against the possibility 
of maneuvering things atom by atom.  It is not an attempt to violate any laws; 
it is something, in principle, which can be done; but in practice, it has not 
been done because we are too big....  Ultimately, we can do chemical 
synthesis... put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the 
substance."  In brief, he sketched another, nonbiochemical path to the 
assembler.  He also stated, even then, that it is "a development which I think 
cannot be avoided."

This book has a lot going for it.  Dawkins provides a good rigorous basis for 
sociobiology, demonstrating a useful set of mental tools for thinking about 
teleology without anthropomorphism.  This is worth the price of admission 
alone.  He also sheds light on the generation gap and the battle of the sexes 
using these tools.  (He explains why, as Bertrand Russell once said on Laughing 
Gas: "hogamus higamus, man is polygamous, higamus hogamus, woman's 
monogomous.")  And then he goes on to do the most useful thing of all: he coins 
the term meme, as an informational analog to gene, and explains it thoroughly.  
The new science of memetics explains why, as Horace said nine hundred years 
ago: "Words challenge eternity."  And how Samuel Butler, who died long before I 
was born, could make this promise to me (and to you):

The essential concept Maynard Smith introduces is that of the evolutionarily 
stable strategy....  A 'strategy' is a pre-programmed behavioral policy.  An 
example of a strategy is: 'Attack oppontent; if he flees pursue him; if he 
retaliates run away.'  It is important to realize that we are not thinking of 
the strategy as being consciously worked out by the individual.  Remember that 
we are picturing the animal as as a robot survival machine with a pre-
programmed computer controlling the muscles.  To write a strategy out as a set 
of simple instructions in English is just a convenient way for us to think 
about it.  By some unspecified mechanism, the animal behaves as if he were 
following these instructions.
<P>
An evolutionarily stable strategy or ESS is defined as a strategy which, if 
most members of the population adopt it, cannot be bettered by an alternative 
strategy.  It is a subtle and important idea.  Another way of putting it is to 
say that the best strategy for an individual depends on what the majority of 
the population are doing.  Since the rest of the population consists of 
individuals, each one trying to maximize his own success, the only strategy 
which persists will be one which, once evolved, cannot be bettered by any 
deviant individual.  Following a major environmental change there may be a 
brief period of evolutionary instability, perhaps even oscillation in the 
population.  But once an ESS is achieved it will stay; selection will penalize 
deviation from it.

I almost didn't list this book because I'm still annoyed by Hardin's whole

Bomb/Limits to Growth doom-saying myself...  I am listing it here because it's 
a good introduction to some of the central problems of Darwin's theory of 
evolution (including bravely facing some of the necessary paradoxes and sticky 
ethical issues inherent in Darwin's ideas), and the theory of evolution was the 
first in Western science to use cybernetic explanation in its arguments.  
Hardin makes the theory even more explicitly cybernetic, especially with the 
aid of some excellent diagrams.

Those who take an interest in the transmission of ideas have often pointed out 
how a concept may be first be developed in the "exact sciences" (physics, 
chemistry) and then move out into the less exact (biology, psychology), perhaps 
even reaching those dimly scientific regions called the social sciences.  There 
is a hierarchy of prestige among the sciences that makes it easy for us to see 
examples of transmission in this direction.  What has been less often noticed 
is that ideas may just as well go the other way: in the idea of cybernetics we 
have a clear-cut example.  The principle of the survival of the fittest, said 
John Maynard Keynes, is just a vast generalization of Ricardian economics.  We 
need now to see what this cryptic statement means, in order not only to 
understand the origin of an important idea, but also to see the source of some 
enduring conflicts in human thought.
<P>
An idea is always older than its name.  The idea of cybernetics was used 
implicitly by the French physiologist, Claude Bernard, in 1787.  The Scottish 
physicist, Clerk Maxwell, used it in 1868 in developing the theory of the 
steam-engine governor.  But long before both of them Adam Smith had just as 
clearly used the idea in his Wealth of Nations (1776).  The "invisible hand" 
that regulates prices to a nicety is clearly this idea.  In a free market, says 
Smith in effect, prices are regulated by negative feedback.  The line of 
thought begun by Smith was carried through in greater detail in the early 
1800's by the London stock speculator and brilliant amateur economist, David 
Ricardo.  Because his work is more thorough (and perhaps also because 
"Smithian" is un-Englishic) the name "Ricardian economics" is often applied to 
this system of thought.

Some of the ideas I've gotten from McLuhan are:
<UL>
<LI>the medium is the message (the message in a medium itself drowns out any 
"content" delivered through it)
<LI>the newest media are always invisible, except by side-effects
<LI>the content of a new medium is always an older displaced medium, which 
becomes visible and "nostalgic" as a result of being "re-framed" in this way
<LI>your skill set for processing reality gets established during your childhood, 
shaped by the media you learned through; therefore it becomes useful to call 
those born in the 1910's "book babies," those born in the 1930's "radio 
babies," those born in the 1950's "television babies," and those born in the 
1970's "computer babies"

"The medium is the message" means, in terms of the electronic age, that a 
totally new environment has been created.  The "content" of this new 
environment is the old mechanized environment of the industrial age.  The new 
environment reprocesses the old one as radically as TV is reprocessing the 
film.  For the "content" of TV is the movie.  TV is environmental and 
imperceptible, like all environments.  We are aware only of the "content" or 
the old environment.  When machine production was new, it gradually created an 
environment whose content was the old environment of agrarian life and the arts 
and crafts.  This older environment was elevated to an art form by the new 
mechanical environment.  The machine turned Nature into an art form.  For the 
first time men began to regard Nature as source of aesthetic and spiritual 
values.  They began to marvel that earlier ages had been so unaware of the 
world of Nature as Art.  Each new technology creates a new environment which is 
itself regarded as corrupt and degrading.  Yet the new one turns its 
predecessor into an art form.  When writing was new, Plato transformed the old 
oral dialog into an art form.  When printing was new the Middle Ages became an 
art form.  "The Elizabethan world view" was a view of the Middle Ages.  And the 
industrial age turned the Renaissance into an art form as seen in the work of 
Jacob Burckhardt.  Siegfried Giedion, in turn, has in the electric age taught 
us to see the entire process of mechanization as an art process.

As Thomas Pynchon said in Gravity's Rainbow, "If they can get you asking the 
wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers."  That's the whole 
point of the Judo-like statement "the medium is the message" -- it's designed 
to shock you into realizing you were asking the wrong questions.  But you can 
get thoroughly "McLuhanized," pick up the lingo and talk "media speak" up a 
storm, and still be asking the wrong questions.  Since McLuhan wrote (lineal, 
mechanized, pre-electronic) books, many of his "followers" stayed in a lineal 
thinking trap -- even while contemplating a simutaneous global village -- and 
many of the "hip" young people who could more easily grasp his ideas (the "TV 
babies") were put off by his pages of type with no pictures.  So, this book is 
a sort of collage-book, graphically bold and innovative (for 1967), facilitated 
by a guy named Jerome Agel  -- who also did <I>I Seem To Be a Verb</I> with Bucky 
Fuller, <I>The Making of Kubrick's 2001</I>, and other collage-books in the late 60's.

This is the best book on McLuhan's ideas to give an MTV baby, too.

There is a world of difference between the modern home environment of 
integrated electronic information and the classroom.  Today's television child 
is attuned to the up-to-the-minute "adult" news -- inflation, rioting, war, 
taxes, crime, bathing beauties -- and is bewildered when he enters the 
nineteenth-century environment that characterizes the educational establishment 
where information is scarce but ordered and structured by fragmented, 
classified patterns, subjects, and schedules.  It is naturally an environment 
much like any factory set-up with its inventories and assembly lines.

"Love thy label as thyself."  -- Joyce

In Kandangan village the people became co-producers with us in making a film.  
The initial proposal came from us, but the actual filming of an initiation 
ceremony became largely their production....  The initiates were barely 
conscious at the end of their ordeal, but they grinned happily when shown 
Polaroid shots of their scarified backs.  The elders asked to have the sound 
track played back to them.  They then asked that the film be brought back and 
projected, promising to erect another sacred enclosure for the screening.
<P>
Finally they announced that this was to be the last involuntary initiation, and 
they offered for sale their sacred water drums, the most sacred objects in this 
ceremony.  Film threatened to replace a ceremony hundreds, perhaps thousands, 
of years old.

[French Guinea prince] Modupe left Africa for the United States where he 
studied anthropology, then worked for MGM as an actor and consultant.  To avoid 
offending African governments, MGM insisted that no film on Africa resemble 
Africa.  Moduope's task was purely creative: design buildings, songs, shields, 
dances, masks, even "languages," all of which Americans would accept as 
authentically African but which no African would recognize as his.  Module was 
so successful at this that he convinced even Africans and they modified their 
art accordingly.

To depict a whole object on a flat surface, literate man employs three-
dimensional perspective: he shows only that surface visible from a single 
position at a single moment.  In short, he fails.
<P>
In contrast, native artists of British Columbia represent a bear, say, in full 
face and profile, from back, above and below, from within and without, all 
simultaneously.  By an extraordinary mixture of convention and realism, these 
butcher-draftsmen skinned and boned and even removed the entrails, to to 
construct a new being, on a flat surface, that retained every significant 
element of the whole creature.

To exercise control over the environment limits its freedom to influence us.
We act in such a way as to make its influence a product, in part, of our own
efforts -- that is, we help create the stimulus to which we respond.  Control
means we put a bit of us in the environment and then treat it as if it were a
wholly independent stimulus.
<P>
Control thus dulls and deadens our experience. The more we control our
environment the less possible it is to experience novelty, however avidly we
seek it and seek to coerce it.  For novelty and freshness cannot be coerced --
cannot be commissioned or scheduled, like a happening.  They are dependent for
their very existence on our having no control over them.  To pursue them is to
destroy them. </I>[p. 10]

Margalef presents a heuristsic theory of ecology, arrived at by Bertalanffy's 
method of rejecting systems of differential equations as unsoluble and 
then patiently rigorizing cybernetic "rules of thumb" gained intuitively by 
examining lots of data -- in his case on algae.  A very good condensation of 
the book, with great new diagrams, appeared in the Summer 1975 issue of the 
CoEvolution Quarterly (listed below under Whole Earth Review).

A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF ORGANIZATION
<P>
Everywhere in nature we can draw arbitrary surfaces and arbitrarily declare 
them boundaries separating two subsystems.  More often than not it turns out 
that such boundaries are asymmetric; they separate two subsystems that, 
although arbitrarily limited, are different in their degrees of organization.  
There is some energy exchange between the two sub-systems in the sense that the 
less-organized subsystem gives energy to the more-organized subsystem, and, in 
the process of exchange, some information in the less-organized is destroyed 
and some information is gained by the already more-organized.  Probably it is 
useful from the point of view of general science (but distracting from the 
point of view of ecology) to remember a few such couplings: gas/Maxwell demon, 
electrical conductor/semiconductor, atmosphere/sea, environment/thermostat, 
substrate/enzyme, enzyme/RNA, cytoplasm/nucleus, mesenchym/nervous system, 
biotop/community, plants/animals, prey/predator, plankton/benthos, agrarian 
communites/industrial societies.

Computer simulations predict that, as Werner Erhardt once said, "If we 
don't change course, we will very likely end up where we're headed."  In this 
case we are headed for a massive die-off due to overpopulation, pollution, lack 
of resources and/or economic depresion triggered by the above.  This makes the 
human agenda from here on out quite clear.  Most of the people who attacked 
these conclusions did so by attacking the methodology.  The methodology is 
correct, it just needs to be refined.  (We went from having no rigorous model 
of the world system to having a simple, inaccurate one.)  And in fact, then 
model has been refined, and more recent conclusions are less dire in the short 
term.  But all modelers agree we need more modeling.

In this book Maxwell's Demon at last is slain.  The thermodynamics of 
Boltzmann tells us that if you put a bunch of gas molecules in one side of a 
chamber by temporarily using a barrier, when you remove the barrier the gas 
will fill the chamber evenly, increasing the entropy of the system.  The 
dynamics of Newton tells us that if you then reverse the direction of each gas 
molecule's motion, they will all end up on one side of the chamber again (if 
only briefly), despite the apparent decrease in entropy which results.
<P>
This book explores this paradox between dynamics and thermodynamics, and 
concludes that "reversing the directions of the molecules" imparts a tremendous 
amount of negentropy (negative entropy, or information) to the system.  
Similarly, a "stacked" deck of cards may appear random upon casual observation, 
but when it is dealt to the right number of players and one of them has a Royal 
Flush, it becomes obvious that the entropy of the stacked deck was much lower 
(and therefore the information content much higher) than a random arrangement.

To come back to our previous question, how can the world of processes and the 
world of trajectories ever be linked together?
<P>
However, while it is easy to criticize the subjectivistic interpretation of 
irreversibility and to point out its weaknesses, it is not so easy to go beyond 
it and formulate an "objective" theory of irreversible processes.  The history 
of the subject has some dramatic overtones.  Many people believe that it is the 
recognition of the basic difficulties involved that may have lead to 
Boltzmann's suicide in 1906.

George Gamov, though a great physicist who helped build quantum theory and the 
atom bomb, was a hilarious prankster and wrote very droll books.  This book is 
a reprint in paperback of <I>Mr. Thomkins In Wonderland</I> (1940) and <I>Mr. Thompkins 
Explores the Atom</I> (1945), delightful stories in which the love-struck Mr. 
Thompkins tries to impress his girlfriend's father, a physics professor, by 
attending the old man's public lectures.  But Mr. Thompkins is always lulled to 
sleep by the lecture, and dreams incredible dreams in which twentieth-century 
physics is made comprehensible to the layperson, mostly by altering the scale 
of physical constants to see what would happen.

Quantum physics is a 51-year-old theory and still most scientists can't make it 
fit common sense and so they reject the theory emotionally.  Feynman accepts it 
emotionally and understands enough to see some of its astounding consequences.  
In this book he explains Quantum Electro-Dynamics (QED) without resorting to 
extrapolating it from Newtonian approximations, thereby freeing the ideas from 
their nineteenth-century baggage.  QED describes the interaction of photons 
(radiant energy) and electrons (the outer shell of matter), and so is the 
theory of all the physics and chemistry we experience in normal life.

If you want to learn physics, with intuition and rigor being given equal 
attention, there is no better source than the three-volume Feynman lectures.  
They are edited transcripts of tape recordings of freshman lectures by Feynman 
at Cal Tech, and therefore have a flowing, personable style that can sustain 
the reader; plus it's excellent physics.  Feynman never approximates or 
simplifies without telling you that is what he is doing.  Why study physics to 
learn systems theory?  Because the deterministic, reductionist dogma still 
asserts that we will eventually break everything down to physics, and whether 
that is true or not we will have to study physics to find out.

...there is a physical problem that is common to many fields, that is very old, 
and that has not been solved.  It is not the problem of finding new fundamental 
particles, but something left over from a long time ago -- over a hundred 
years.  Nobody in physics has been able to analyze it mathematically 
satisfactorily in spite of its importance to the sister sciences.  It is the 
analysis of circulating or turbulent fluids.  If we watch the evolution of a 
star, there comes a point where we can deduce that it is going to start 
convection, and thereafter we can no longer deduce what should happen.  A few 
million years later the star explodes, but we cannot figure out the reason.  We 
cannot analyze the weather.  We do not know the patterns of motions there 
should be inside the earth.  The simplest form of the problem is to take a pipe 
that is very long and push water through it at high speed.  We ask: to push a 
given amount of water through that pipe, how much pressure is needed?  No one 
can analyze it from first principles and the properties of water.  If the water 
flows very slowly, or if we use a thick goo like honey, then we can do it 
nicely.  You will find that in your textbook.  What we really cannot do is deal 
with actual, wet water running through a pipe.  That is the central problem 
which we ought to solve some day, and we have not.

The objection could be raised that all this happens quite automatically 
according to the fixed rules of cause and effect.  But in these processes cause 
and effect so often change places.  In many processes in the realm of the 
liquid element the cause is in the same moment also effect and the effect at 
the same moment cause, whereby they unite in manifold interplay to form a 
moving totality.  Just as in a living organism cause and effect intermingle in 
a simultaneous correlation, so they do also in water.

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
<UL>-- Arthur C. Clark, Profiles of the Future </UL>
<P>
Einstein's gravity theory allows many shapes for a time machine.  In fact, it 
seems that any rotating object that is dense enough to produce a region with a 
twisted ultra-gravity field can produce time-confusing regions.  There are some 
shapes, however, that can produce time-travel regions that might be usable to 
humans.  One gravitational mass configuration that can act as a time machine is 
a large, rapidly rotating, dense obect that is collapsing to a black hole just 
as its spin speed is rising to that of light.  This extreme version of a 
spinning, collapsing star can be described quite accurately by a mathematically 
rigorous solution to the full, nonlinear Einstein gravity equations.  No 
approximations are used.  This solution is called the Kerr metric, after the 
theorist Roy Kerr, who probably was dismayed when he found that the 
mathematical beauty that he had discovered not only described something 
physical, but something that might have some future application.

A compelling vision of the future of interactive computers.   Only through 
metaphorical illusions can our minds handle the complexity and bandwidth of 
data transfer with computers which the future will require of us.  The Army 
will study the fantasy gamers, to learn their interfacing technniques.  This 
vision was considered ridiculous for years, then suddenly it was obvious.

In the once-upon-a-time days of the First Age of Magic, the prudent sorcerer 
regarded his own true name as his most valued possesion but also the greatest 
threat to his continued good health, for -- the stories go -- once an enemy, 
even a weak unskilled enemy, learned the sorcerer's true name, then routine and 
widely known spells could destroy or enslave even the most powerful.  As time 
passed, and we graduated to the Age of Reason and thence to the first and 
second industrial revolutions, such notions were discredited.  Now it seems 
that the Wheel has turned full circle (even if there never really was a First 
Age) and we are back to worrying about true names again:
<P>
The first hint that Mr. Slippery had that his own true name might be known -- 
and for that matter, known to the Great Enemy -- came with the appearance of 
two black Lincolns humming up the long dirt driveway that stretched through the 
dripping pine forest down to Road 29.

The Dynamo and the Virgin
<P>
Historian Henry Adams came away from the 1900 Trocadero Exposition in Paris
with a new way of viewing the machine.  He concluded that what the Church had
been to medieval culture, the dynamo was to ours -- an idea he expressed by
metaphorically juxtaposing "The Dynamo and the Virgin" in The Education of
Henry Adams.  In it he wrote: "The new American, like the new European, was the
servant of the power house."

Bjerknes' Weather Mechanics
<P>
With the advent of the telegraph came widespread simultaneous weather reports.
Forecasters drew weather charts, then made predictions by following the
movement of weather conditions across them.
<P>
But Norwegian physicist Vilhelm Bjerknes saw that accurate forecasting would
depend on mathematical techniques for describing atmospheric behavior.  He
shifted the focus of weather prediction back to problems of mechanics and
physics.
<P>
However, the mathematical techniques Bjerknes sought did not appear until Lewis
Fry Richardson developed them during World War I.  And the technology for
implementing them did not appear until the forties.
<P>
A student of Poincare and Heinrich Hertz, Vilhelm Bjerknes' early training was
in the field of hydrodynamics.  His work on electronic resonance aided in the
development of the electromagnetic theory of radiation.
<P>
Weather Forecasting as a Problem in Mechanics and Physics, in which Bjerknes
suggested methods of predicting weather by translating weather data into
mathematical terms, was first published in [Meteorologische Zeitschrift, an]
Austrian meteorological journal in 1904.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
When the practicality of his work was challenged, Bjerknes replied: "It may
require many years to bore a tunnel through a mountain.  Many a laborer may not
live to see the cut finished.  Nevertheless this will not prevent later comers
from riding through the tunnel at express-train speed."
<P>
A Weather Forecast Factory
<P>
Nearly forty years before electronic computers, Lewis Fry Richardson imagined a
"forecasting factory" in which thousands of mathematicians raced the weather
around the globe.  From this factory he developed the basis for a model for
numerical weather prediction.  The model was fundamentally the same as that
used today by computers.
<P>
"After so much hard reasoning, may one play with a fantasy?  Imagine a large
hall like a theater.... The walls of this chamber are painted to form a map of
the globe.  The ceiling represents the north polar regions, England is in the
gallery, the tropics in the upper circle, Australia on the dress circle and
the antarctic in the pit.  A myriad of computers [human] are at work upon the
weather of the part of the map where each sits, but each computer attends to
only one equation or part of equation... Numerous little 'night signs' display
the instantaneous values so that neighboring computers can read them.  Each
number is thus displayed in three adjacent zones so as to maintain communi-
cation to the North and South on the map.  From the floor of the pit a tall
pillar rises to half the height of the hall.  It carries a large pulpit on
its top.  In this sits the man in charge of the whole theater... One of his
duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of the globe.
In this respect he is like the conductor of an orchestra in which the instru-
ments are slide-rules and calculating machines.  But instead of waving a baton
he turns a beam of rosy light upon those who are behindhand."
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
In his book The Mathematical Psychology of War, Richardson tried to apply
mathematical concepts and techniques to the examination of human conflict.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
Richardson was a Quaker and conscientious objector.  His wife recalled,
"There came a time of heartbreak when those most interested in his 'upper air'
researches proved to be the 'poison gas' experts.  Lewis stopped his
meteorology researches, destroying such as had not been published.  What this
cost him none will ever know!"

What sorts of tools?  Computing is a broad field, and we can't begin to cover
every kind of application.  Instead we have concentrated on an activity which
is central to programming -- tools that help us develop other programs.  They
are programs that we use regularly, most of them every day; we used essentially
all of them while we were writing this book.
<P>

<P>
How should we test [a program to count the lines in a file] to make sure it
really works?  When bugs occur, they usually arise at the "boundaries" or
extremes of program operation.  These are the "exceptions that prove the rule."
Here the boundaries are fairly simple: a file with no lines and a file with one
line.  If the code handles these cases correctly, and and the general case of a
file with more than one line, it is probable that it will handle all inputs
correctly.

If you program, and you're not using the C language and the UNIX operating 
system, you're probably working too hard.  C is the only langauge designed by a 
programmer for programmers to code in.  (When FORTRAN was designed there were 
no programmers; it was for engineers.  PASCAL was to teach programming.  BASIC 
was used to teach graduate students how to implement an interpreter, etc...) 
Most operating systems are written by hardware vendors to run only on their 
systems, are incompatible with anything else, and are rushed out the door 
before they are ready to help sell a specific piece of equipment.  UNIX and C 
were developed by programmers at Bell Labs over a period of twelve years, 
during which the Federal government would not let the phone company sell 
software.  The honed the language and the system into a marvelously powerful 
toolkit. This book is an excellent guide to using these toolkits together.

"COEVOLUTION" -- The term was coined in 1965 by Paul Ehrlich and Peter Raven in
their study of the predator-prey relationship of caterpillars and plants.  They
found that the eaters and the eaten evolved in close response to each other --
coevolution.  (Some plants developed defensive alkaloid poisons.  Some
caterpillars developed a taste for alkaloids.  The plants diversified wildly.
The caterpillars diversified with them.  What really evolved was the
relationship, stably dynamic, unpredicatble and sure.)
<P>
It seems that all evolution is coevolution.  The beauty of the term is what it
adds to the concepts of ecology.  Language such as "preserving the ecology"
suggests something quite perfect -- static, knowable, oriented backward,
unwelcoming to human foolishness... unreal.  Ecology is whole system alright,
but coevolution is whole system in TIME.  The health of it is forward --
systemic self-education which feeds on constant imperfection.  We coevolving
watchers and meddlers are not left out of it.

Ecology maintains.
Coevolution learns.

the best way was to learn differential equations.  He said play with 
Mathematica.  Apparently you can, for example, construct the chaotic system of 
differential equations which generate the Lorenz attractor, and then watch as 
the attractor is traced out.  The program runs on the Macintosh as well as 
Stardent's graphics supercomputers.  The chief architect of Mathematica, Steve

Bill Atkinson wrote MacPaint for the first Apple Macintosh computer, and as a 
believer in the "hacker ethic" (see <I>Hackers</I>, above) wanted it given away to all 
Mac users.  This policy was reversed behinf Bill's back about the time he came 
up with a grand vision for an open software package to do hypertext on the Mac.
<P> 
He went to John Scully and the executive staff of Apple and said: "What I want 
is to bundle [HyperCard].  If you want to bundle it, I'll write it for Apple.  
You can have the exclusive proprietary rights and all that stuff, but if you 
don't want to bundle it then it's time for me to graduate from Apple and become 
an independent developer myself.  I'm going to get this out to the people 
whether I give it away or whether I get Apple to give it away."  So Apple 
accepted his terms, and hypercard has become the de-facto standard in hypertext 
software.  Because of its open design, there is no way to "lock" a hypercard 
program (called a "stack") so that others can't see it; there is no such thing 
as "source code" which is unavailable at run time.  A powerful mind tool from a 
brilliant visionary.

Perhaps it is a bit unfair for me to list here software which now runs only on 
a $100,000 Graphics Supercomputer, but this software is so useful and amazing.  
AVS allows the easy interactive visualization of static or changing scientific 
data, from measurements or simulations, using a visual programming interface 
(with a mouse and menus) to achieve a visualization workbench, where "what-if" 
experiments in data representation can be immediately performed.  It makes very 
good use of the human-machine graphical interface to accomplish visualization.
<P>
AVS is currently available from AVS, Inc.

Many of the mathematical models described in the above works can be easily and 
enjoyably simulated on a Personal Computer.  I'm surprised more of this has not 
been done.  Consider that Commodore 64 computer, usually thought of as "a toy," 
can be bought for a song at a swap meet in 1990, and yet has more compute 
capability than Whirlwind or Eniac or any of the first eletronic digital 
computers.  It is easy, given a complete spec, to program a modern PC to 
emulate an early digital computer, an analog device, or any rigorous model of a 
system.  I myself have written two such simulations: one of Ross Ashby's 
homeostat (see Design for a Brain, above) using text output to dislay results 
on a Data General minicomputer, and the other of of a general Markov machine 
(see An Introduction to Cybernetics, also by Ashby) which displayed its 
changing states graphically on an Apple II+ microcomputer.  This type of 
programming project is very educational for the programmer, and has additional 
educational value to those who play with the finished programs.

Play Monopoly, Diplomacy, Risk, Dungeons and Dragons, and/or The Battle of 
Shiloh, all available in box form.  Find a group perpuating the underground 
political-economic-military game, "Empire."  Get some of those pop-sociology 
simulation games that first appeared in the late sixties.  Play physical 
strategy games, like Capture the Flag, Laser Tag and Paint-Gun War.  Design 
your own games and play them.  All the really important work gets done during 
play.

Find a system and study it.  Use the disciplines of one or more of the natural 
sciences.  Check the literature.  Take good notes.  Form testable conclusions, 
and test them.  Publish your results somehow.

In Utopia or Oblivion, Bucky Fuller said: "My experience teaches me that all 
philosophic concepts which are translated only into 'bright ideas' as voiced or 
written suggestions or criticisms are abortions of intellect's higher 
potentials.  My experience teaches me that philosophic conclusions which are 
always teleologically derived may always be reduced to design-science changes 
in the environment which can permit other individuals spontaneous realization 
of higher destiny, i.e.,  behaving unconsciously in more effective manner.  For 
instance, a turn in a highway may be banked angularly..."

In my course at UCSC in Understanding Whole Systems the final paper was to be 
on a real problem that the student had solved.  Some were frightened of the 
world beyond the ivory tower and copped out; others made a real difference.  I 
have always found making a real difference to be the most educational and 
empowering thing I can do.

     Definition of Cybernetics
   </h1>
   
   <p>
    Cybernetics, the theory of intercausal networks underlaying communication and organization processes in dynamical systems, forms a metatheoretical superstructure for individual subdisciplines as systems theory, communication theory, connectionism or decision analysis. Yet, applied cybernetics serves as auxiliary science for practical fields as biology, psychology, medicine and technology.  <br>
Complemenatary to this sectoral segmentation cybernetics can be classified into several layers. The inner layer is formed by general theoretical cybernetics (K1) that finds its concretization in the investigation of the realities (K2). Among the K2 the above mentioned subdisciplines (as general systems theory, control theory, information theory or game theory) are to be counted. Practical applications of cybernetics (biological cybernetics, control systems technology, computer science etc.) fall into the external layer (K3).  <br>
Founded by von Foerster 'Second-order cybernetics' denotes a progressive intellectual movement within cybernetics and systems thinking that reached fruition in the 1970's. The most common explanation for the movement's agenda is that it turned the principles of cybernetics upon cybernetics itself. In second-order cybernetics, the observer of a system must be described and explained as well as the system observed.  <br>
Practicability and consistent links to microtheories of the applied sciences are critical for the K3's success.

<h2 class='title'>What is cybernetics?</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
<b><br/>Cybernetics</b> is the interdisciplinary study of the structure of regulatory systems. Cybernetics is closely related to control theory and systems theory. Both in its origins and in its evolution in the second-half of the 20th century, cybernetics is equally applicable to physical and social (that is, language-based) systems.<br/><br/>Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, anthropology, and psychology in the 1940s, often attributed to the Macy Conferences.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br/><br/></span>

<!-- start content -->    <p><b>Simulated reality</b> is the proposition that reality could be simulated&#8212;perhaps by computer simulation&#8212;to a degree indistinguishable from "true" reality. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not know that they are living inside a simulation. In its strongest form, the "simulation hypothesis" claims it is possible and even probable that we are actually living in such a simulation.</p> <p>This is different from the current, technologically achievable concept of virtual reality. Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of "true" reality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience. Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to distinguish from "true" reality.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">The idea of a simulated reality raises several questions:</p> <ul><li>Is it possible, even in principle, to tell whether we are in a simulated reality?</li><li>Is there any difference between a simulated reality and a "real" one?</li><li>How should we behave if we knew that we were living in a simulated reality?</li></ul><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[  if (window.showTocToggle) { var tocShowText = "show"; var tocHideText = "hide"; showTocToggle(); }  //]]> </script> <p><a name="Types_of_simulation" id="Types_of_simulation"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline"></span></span></h2><h2><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Types of simulation</span></span></h2> <p><a name="Brain-computer_interface" id="Brain-computer_interface"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Brain-computer interface</span></span></h3> <p>In a brain-computer interface simulation, each participant enters from outside, directly connecting their brain to the simulation computer. The computer transfers sensory data to them and reads their desires and actions back; in this manner they interact with the simulated world and receive feedback from it. The participant may even receive adjustment in order to temporarily forget that they are inside a virtual realm (e.g. "passing through the veil"). While inside the simulation, the participant's consciousness is represented by an avatar, which could look very different from the participant's actual appearance.</p><p><br /></p> <p><a name="Simulation-brain_communications" id="Simulation-brain_communications"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Simulation-brain communications</span></span></h2> <p>If one were to effectively communicate with the brain, a code or sequence must be created/discovered to send information between the part of our brain that hears and talks.</p> <p><a name="Virtual_people" id="Virtual_people"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Virtual people</span></span></h3> <p>In a virtual-people simulation, every inhabitant is a native of the simulated world. They do not have a "real" body in the external reality. Rather, each is a fully simulated entity, possessing an appropriate level of consciousness that is implemented using the simulation's own logic (i.e. using its own physics). As such, they could be downloaded from one simulation to another, or even archived and resurrected at a later date. It is also possible that a simulated entity could be moved out of the simulation entirely by means of mind transfer into a synthetic body. Another way of getting an inhabitant of the virtual reality out of its simulation would be to "clone" the entity, by taking a sample of its virtual DNA and create a real-world counterpart from that model. The result would not bring the "mind" of the entity out of its simulation, but its body would be born in the real world.</p> <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">This category subdivides into two further types:</p> <ul><li><b>Virtual people-virtual world</b>, in which an external reality is simulated separately to the artificial consciousnesses;</li><li><b>Solipsistic simulation</b> in which consciousness is simulated and the "world" participants perceive exists only within their minds.</li></ul> <p><a name="Emigration" id="Emigration"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Emigration</span></span></h3> <p>In an emigration simulation, the participant enters the simulation from the outer reality, as in the brain-computer interface simulation, but to a much greater degree. On entry, the participant uses mind transfer to temporarily relocate their mental processing into a virtual-person. After the simulation is over, the participant's mind is transferred back into their outer-reality body, along with all new memories and experience gained within (as in the movie The Thirteenth Floor, or when one flatlines in Neuromancer).</p> <p>Also worthy is mentioning the option of a completely virtual-person (born in the simulation) becoming somehow self-aware (after "waking up") and willing to escape the simulation, consequently somehow succeeding to be transferred into an outer-reality person (transcendent to the simulated world), and this option can be contributed to Gurdjieff's aspect in Fourth Way that "humans are not born with a soul. Rather, a man must create a soul through the course of his life".</p> <p>This "creation of a soul" for a (by its nature soulless) virtual-person (part of the Program) would ultimately mean exiting (emigrating) and getting transformed on exit into a real (outer-reality) person, assuming the outer-reality is a realm of Spirit. And the (right) "course of life" in simulation would only be the preparation for that final act of emigration (transferring and related transforming).</p> <p>In this case, since the emigrating inhabitant of the simulation didn't have an associated outer-reality person (user with a "real body"), this virtual person would be transferred into either a new outer-reality person (assuming that possible), or an already existing one, whether being a <i>player</i> of the simulation or not at all. And if being a player, that outer-reality person, as a user, would be previously associated with some other inhabitant from the simulated world and thus with "taking over" (or <i>merging with</i>) this chosen special previous-inhabitant that emigrates, he could choose to destroy that other/old inhabitant, or abandon him (leaving him then in the simulated world without a user temporarily or permanently). Or if neither destroying or abandoning, but willing to further 'play the simulation' and choosing to play that same old inhabitant (that didn't emigrate), he would do that now as a 'transformed' user ('enriched' with an emigrated virtual-person, or now even completely being that previously virtual person, if that was chosen and possible, and as such continuing to play the simulation using a 'new' virtual-person).</p> <p>And the outer-reality person (which as self is transcendent to the simulated world) can be 'something' completely indescribable from the point of the simulated world, but as self(=soul), essentially emanates from the Spirit, with a 'personality' manifesting the Spirit.</p> <p><a name="Intermingled" id="Intermingled"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Intermingled</span></span></h3> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width: 182px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SimulatedReality_MorpheusAndNeoInSmallSimulation.jpg" class="image" title="Morpheus teaches Neo inside a small simulated reality"><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/SimulatedReality_MorpheusAndNeoInSmallSimulation.jpg/180px-SimulatedReality_MorpheusAndNeoInSmallSimulation.jpg" class="thumbimage" width="180" border="0" height="75" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption">  Morpheus teaches Neo inside a small simulated reality</div> </div> </div> <p>An intermingled simulation supports both types of consciousness: "players" from the outer reality who are visiting (as a brain-computer interface simulation) or emigrating, and virtual-people who are natives of the simulation and hence lack any physical body in the outer reality.</p> <p><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix" title="The Matrix"></a></i>The Matrix movies feature an intermingled type of simulation: they contain not only human minds (with their physical bodies remaining outside), but also sentient software programs that govern various aspects of the computed realm.</p><p><br /></p> <p><a name="Arguments" id="Arguments"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Arguments</span></span></h2> <p><a name="We_are_living_in_a_simulation" id="We_are_living_in_a_simulation"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">We are living in a simulation</span></span></h3> <p><a name="Nick_Bostrom.27s_argument" id="Nick_Bostrom.27s_argument"></a></p> <h4><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);" class="mw-headline">Nick Bostrom's argument</span></h4> <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">The philosopher Nick Bostrom investigated the possibility that we may be living in a simulation. A simplified version of his argument proceeds as such:</p> <dl><dd>i. It is <i>possible</i> that a civilization could create a computer simulation which contains individuals with artificial intelligence.</dd><dd>ii. Such a civilization would <i>likely</i> run many&#8212;say billions&#8212;of these simulations (just for fun; for research, etc.)</dd><dd>iii. A simulated individual inside the simulation <i>wouldn&#8217;t necessarily know</i> that it&#8217;s inside a simulation&#8212;it&#8217;s just going about its daily business in what it considers to be the "real world."</dd></dl> <p>Then the ultimate question is&#8212;if one accepts that theses 1, 2, and 3 are at least <i>possible</i>&#8212; which of the following is more likely?</p> <dl><dd>a. We are the <i>one</i> civilization which develops AI simulations and happens not to be in one itself? Or,</dd><dd>b. We are one of the many (<i>billions</i>) of simulations that has run? (Remember point iii.)</dd></dl> <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">In greater detail, his argument attempts to prove the<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"> trichotomy,</span> that:</p> <dl><dd><b>either</b></dd></dl> <ol><li>intelligent races will never reach a level of technology where they can run simulations of reality so detailed they can be mistaken for reality (or this is impossible in principle); <b>or</b></li><li>races who do reach such a level do not tend to run such simulations; <b>or</b></li><li>we are <i>almost certainly</i> living in such a simulation.</li></ol> <p>Bostrom's argument uses the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to simulate entire inhabited planets or even larger habitats or even entire universes as quantum simulations in time/space pockets, including all the people on them, on a computer, and that simulated people can be fully conscious, and are as much persons as non-simulated people.</p> <p>A particular case provided in the original paper poses the scenario where we assume that the human race could reach such a technological level without destroying themselves in the process (i.e. we deny the first hypothesis); and that once we reached such a level we would still be interested in history, the past, and our ancestors, and that there would be no legal or moral strictures on running such simulations (we deny the second hypothesis)&#8212;then</p> <ul><li>it is likely that we would run a very large number of so-called ancestor simulations to study our past;</li><li>and that, by the same line of reasoning, many of these simulations would in turn run other sub-simulations, and so on;</li><li>and that given the fact that right now it is impossible to tell whether we are living in one of the vast number of simulations or the original ancestor universe, the likelihood is that the former is true.</li></ul> <p>Assumptions as to whether the human race (or another intelligent species) could reach such a technological level without destroying themselves depend greatly on the value of the Drake equation, which gives the number of intelligent technological species communicating via radio in a galaxy at any given point in time. The expanded equation looks to the number of posthuman civilizations that ever would exist in any given universe. If the average for all universes, real or simulated, is greater than or equal to one such civilization existing in each universe's entire history, then odds are rather overwhelmingly in favor of the proposition that the average civilization is in a simulation, assuming that such simulated universes are possible and such civilizations would want to run such simulations.</p> <p><a name="Frank_J._Tipler.27s_Omega_Point" id="Frank_J._Tipler.27s_Omega_Point"></a></p> <h4><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);" class="mw-headline">Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point</span></h4>  <p>Physicist Prof. Frank J. Tipler envisages a similar scenario to Nick Bostrom's argument, one that Tipler maintains is a physically required cosmological scenario in the far future of the universe: as the universe comes to an end in a solitary singularity during the Big Crunch, the computational capacity of the universe is capable of increasing at a sufficient rate that is accelerating exponentially faster than the time running out. In principle, a simulation run on this universe-computer can thus continue forever in its own terms, even though proper time lasts only a finite duration.</p> <p>Prof. Tipler identifies this final singularity and its state of infinite information capacity with God. According to Prof. Tipler and Prof. David Deutsch, the implication of this theory for present-day humans is that this ultimate cosmic computer will essentially be able to resurrect everyone who has ever lived, by recreating all possible quantum brain states within the master simulation, somewhat reminiscent of the resurrection ideas of Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov. This would manifest as a simulated reality. From the perspective of the inhabitant, the Omega Point represents an infinite-duration afterlife, which could take any imaginable form due to its virtual nature. At first glance, Tipler's hypothesis requires some means by which the inhabitants of the far future can recover historical information in order to reincarnate their ancestors into a simulated afterlife. However, if they really have access to infinite computing power, that is no problem at all&#8212;they can just simulate "all possible worlds". (This line of thought is continued in Platonic simulation theories). Tipler's argument can also be intertwined with Nick Bostrom's aforementioned argument from probability. If Omega Point will simulate an infinite number of virtual worlds then it would be infinitely more likely that our reality is in one of those simulated worlds, rather than in the lone real world that created the Omega Point.</p> <p>Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory is predicated on an eventual Big Crunch, thought by some to be an unlikely scenario by virtue of a number of recent astronomical observations. Tipler has recently amended his views to accommodate an accelerating universe due to a positive cosmological constant. He proposes baryon tunneling as a means of propelling interstellar spacecraft. He states that if the baryons in the universe were to be annihilated by this process, then this would force the Higgs field toward its absolute vacuum, cancelling the positive cosmological constant, stopping the acceleration, and allowing the universe to collapse into the Omega Point.</p> <p><a name="Computationalism_.26_Platonic_simulation_theories" id="Computationalism_.26_Platonic_simulation_theories"></a></p> <h4><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);" class="mw-headline">Computationalism &amp; Platonic simulation theories</span></h4> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computationalism" title="Computationalism" class="mw-redirect"></a>Computationalism is a philosophy of mind theory stating that cognition is a form of computation. It is relevant to the Simulation Hypothesis in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a "virtual people" simulation. For example, it is well known that physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct, and if there is no problem in generating artificial consciousness from cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. However, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal consciousness is disputed. It is possible that consciousness requires a substrate of "real" physics, and simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be philosophical zombies. This would also seem to negate Nick Bostrom's simulation argument; we cannot be inside a simulation, as conscious beings, if consciousness cannot be simulated. However, we could still be within a simulation, and yet be envatted brains. This would allow us to exist as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if a simulated environment could not simulate consciousness.</p> <p>Some theorists have argued that if the "consciousness-is-computation" version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computationalism" title="Computationalism" class="mw-redirect"></a>computationalism and mathematical realism (also known as mathematical Platonism) are both true our consciousnesses must be inside a simulation. This argument states that a "Plato's heaven" or ultimate ensemble would contain every algorithm, including those which implement consciousness. Platonic simulation theories are also subsets of the multiverse theories and theories of everything.</p> <p><a name="Dreaming" id="Dreaming"></a></p> <h4><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);" class="mw-headline">Dreaming</span></h4>  <p>A dream could be considered a type of simulation capable of fooling someone who is asleep. As a result the "dream hypothesis" cannot be ruled out, although it has been argued that common sense and considerations of simplicity rule against it. One of the first philosophers to question the distinction between reality and dreams was Zhuangzi, a Chinese philosopher from the 4th Century BC. He phrased the problem as the well-known "Butterfly Dream," which went as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be <i>some</i> distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)</p> </blockquote> <p>The philosophical underpinnings of this argument are also brought up by Descartes, who was one of the first Western philosophers to do so. In Meditations on First Philosophy, he states "... there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep", and goes on to conclude that "It is possible that I am dreaming right now and that all of my perceptions are false".</p> <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Chalmers (2003) discusses the dream hypothesis, and notes that this comes in two distinct forms:</p> <ul><li>that he is <i>currently</i> dreaming, in which case many of his beliefs about the world are incorrect;</li><li>that he has <i>always</i> been dreaming, in which case the objects he perceives actually exist, albeit in his imagination.</li></ul> <p>Both the dream argument and the Simulation hypothesis can be regarded as skeptical hypotheses; however in raising these doubts, just as Descartes noted that his own thinking led him to be convinced of his own existence, the existence of the argument itself is testament to the possibility of its own truth.</p> <p>Another state of mind in which an individual's perceptions have no physical basis in the real world is called psychosis.</p> <p><a name="Computability_of_physics" id="Computability_of_physics"></a></p> <h4><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);" class="mw-headline">Computability of physics</span></h4>  <p>A decisive refutation of any claim that our reality is computer-simulated would be the discovery of some uncomputable physics, because if reality is doing something no computer can do, it cannot be a computer simulation. In fact, known physics is held to be computable.</p> <p>The objection could be made that the simulation does not have to run in "real time". But it misses an important point: the shortfall is not linear, rather it is a matter of performing an infinite number of computational steps in a finite time. This objection does not apply if the hypothetical simulation is being run on a hypercomputer, a machine more powerful than a Turing machine. Unfortunately, there is no way of working out if computers running a simulation are capable of doing things that computers in the simulation cannot do. No one has shown that the laws of physics inside a simulation and those outside it have to be the same, and simulations of different physical laws have been constructed. The problem now is that there is no evidence that can conceivably be produced to show that the universe is not any kind of computer, making the Simulation Hypothesis unfalsifiable and therefore scientifically unacceptable, at least by Popperian standards.</p> <p><a name="CantGoTu_Environments" id="CantGoTu_Environments"></a></p> <h4><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);" class="mw-headline">CantGoTu Environments</span></h4> <p>The concept of a CantGoTu Environment takes the ideas embedded in the Diagonal Argument of George Cantor, the Undecidability theorems of Kurt Gdel, and the limits of computability highlighted by Alan Turing, and applies them to Virtual Reality environments. The argument is set out in The Fabric of Reality (1997) by David Deutsch, and runs thus:</p> <dl><dd>Imagine a computer built to render every possible Virtual Reality. Suppose all possible environments produced by this generator can be laid out sequentially, as Environment 1, Environment 2, etc. Take time slices through each of these of equal duration. (Deutsch specifies one minute, but this could, in principle be anything, e.g. Planck time.) Now construct a new environment as follows. In the first time-period, generate in the environment anything which is different from Environment 1, and in the second time period, anything different from Environment 2, and so on. This new environment cannot be found in the sequential layout of environments specified earlier, as it differs from all possible environments by what happens in one particular time-slice. Hence this means that no such universal VR generator can be created, and there are environments which effectively can <i>never</i> be rendered by any means (since there are infinitely many).</dd></dl> <p>[Yet if all possible virtual reality initial conditions have been simulated and still it is possible to create a reality that plays out differently to those already created (despite starting at an initial condition common to one of those already in existence) then that extra environment must obey slightly different cause and effect laws of reality, or else it would simply play out in the same way as one of those already simulated. This implies that the argument by Deutsch is only valid if the laws that govern each virtual reality may be different: i.e. they would have to allow inconsistencies such as objects suddenly disappearing or appearing out of nowhere for every time an environment transitions from one time slot to another. If instead one simply assumes that there are infinitely many possible initial conditions, since they vary by infinitesimally small amounts, then (even if all follow the same laws) there will be infinitely many possible virtual realities that could be generated, which leads to the same conclusion as Deutsch.]</p> <p>However, later on in the book, Deutsch goes on to argue for a very strong version of the Turing principle, namely: "It is possible to build a virtual reality generator whose repertoire includes every <i>physically possible</i> environment."</p> <p>However, in order to include <i>every physically possible environment</i>, the computer would have to be able to include a full simulation of the environment containing <i>itself</i>. Even so, a computer running a simulation need not have to run every possible physical moment to be plausible to its inhabitants.</p> <p><a name="Computational_load" id="Computational_load"></a></p> <h4><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);" class="mw-headline">Computational load</span></h4> <dl><dt>Virtual people</dt></dl> <p>As of 2007<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display: none;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simulated_reality&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simulated_reality&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">[update]</a></sup>, the computational requirements for molecular dynamics are such that it takes several months of computing time on the world's fastest computers to simulate 1/10th of one second of the folding of a single protein molecule.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag failed verification of its source citation(s) since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;"></span></sup> To simulate an entire galaxy would require more computing power than can presently be envisioned, assuming that no shortcuts are taken when simulating areas that nobody is observing.</p> <p>In answer to this objection, Bostrom calculated that simulating the brain functions of all humans who have ever lived would require roughly 10<sup>33</sup> to 10<sup>36</sup> calculations.

In any case, a simulation need not compute every single molecular event that occurs inside it; it may only process events that its participants can actively perceive.

An interesting question is whether knowledge of bugs or loopholes in a sufficiently powerful simulation are instantly erased the minute they are observed since presumably all thoughts and experiences in a simulated world could be carefully monitored and altered.

The hypothesis was pioneered in Konrad Zuse's book Rechnender Raum (translated by MIT into English as Calculating Space, 1970), which focuses on cellular automata. Juergen Schmidhuber suggested that the universe could be a Turing machine, because there is a very short program that outputs all possible programmes in an asymptotically optimal way. Other proponents include Edward Fredkin, Stephen Wolfram, and Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft. They hold that the apparently probabilistic nature of quantum physics is not incompatible with the notion of computability. A quantum version of digital physics has recently been proposed by Seth Lloyd. None of these suggestions has been developed into a workable physical theory.</p> <p>It <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_universe_theory" title="Computational universe theory" class="mw-redirect"></a>can be argued that the use of continua in physics constitutes a possible argument against the simulation of a physical universe. Removing the real numbers and uncountable infinities from physics would counter some of the objections noted above, and at least make computer simulation a possibility. However, digital physics must overcome these objections. For instance, cellular automata would appear to be a poor model for the non-locality of quantum mechanics.</p><p><br /></p> <p><a name="Other_issues" id="Other_issues"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Other issues</span></span></h2> <p><a name="Non-player_characters_or_.22bots.22" id="Non-player_characters_or_.22bots.22"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Non-player characters or "bots"</span></span></h3> <p>Some of the people in a simulated reality may be automatons, philosophical zombies, or 'bots' added to the simulation to make it more realistic or interesting or challenging.

Therefore, if the simulation were to run faster or slower, those brains could notice because they were not contained within it.</p> <p>It is possible that time passes slower or quicker for brains in a dream state (i.e., in a brain-computer interface trance); however, the point is that they still function at a finite, <i>biological</i> speed, and the simulation must track with them.

J. Good first wrote of an "intelligence explosion", suggesting that if machines could even slightly surpass human intellect, they could improve their own designs in ways unforeseen by their designers, and thus recursively augment themselves into far greater intelligences. The first such improvements might be small, but as the machine became more intelligent it would become better at becoming more intelligent, which could lead to an exponential and quite sudden growth in intelligence.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge" title="Vernor Vinge"></a>Vernor Vinge later called this event "the Singularity" as an analogy between the breakdown of modern physics near a gravitational singularity and the drastic change in society he argues would occur following an intelligence explosion. In the 1980s, Vinge popularized the singularity in lectures, essays, and science fiction. More recently, some prominent technologists such as Bill Joy, founder of Sun Microsystems, voiced concern over the potential dangers of Vinge's singularity (Joy 2000). Following its introduction in Vinge's stories, particularly Marooned in Realtime and A Fire Upon the Deep, the singularity has also become a common plot element in science fiction.</p> <p>Others, most prominently Ray Kurzweil, define the singularity as a period of extremely rapid technological progress. Kurzweil argues such an event is implied by a long-term pattern of accelerating change that generalizes Moore's Law to technologies predating the integrated circuit and which he argues will continue to other technologies not yet invented. Critics of Kurzweil's interpretation consider it an example of static analysis, citing particular failures of the predictions of Moore's Law.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson" title="Robin Hanson"></a>Robin Hanson proposes that multiple "singularities" have occurred throughout history, dramatically affecting the growth rate of the economy. Like the agricultural and industrial revolutions of the past, the technological singularity would increase economic growth between 60 and 250 times. An innovation that allowed for replacement of virtually all human labor could trigger this singularity.</p> <p>Critics allege that the singularity concept does not take into account increased energy resource usage by the new technologies, or the current physical (atomic) limits in electronic components miniaturization. However, by its nature, the theory implies the creation of currently unknown technologies and relies on the concept of improvements in one field affecting another &#8212; an event paralleled in the industrial revolution.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[  if (window.showTocToggle) { var tocShowText = "show"; var tocHideText = "hide"; showTocToggle(); }  //]]> </script> <p><a name="Intelligence_explosion" id="Intelligence_explosion"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Intelligence explosion</span></span></h2> <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Singularity#CITEREFGood1965" title=""></a><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Good (1965) specul</span>ated on the consequences of machines smarter than humans:</p> <blockquote> <p>Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an &#8216;intelligence explosion,&#8217; and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mathematician and author Vernor Vinge greatly popularized Good&#8217;s notion of an intelligence explosion in the 1980s, calling the creation of the first ultraintelligent machine the Singularity. Vinge first addressed the topic in print in the January 1983 issue of Omni magazine. Vinge (1993) contains the oft-quoted statement, "Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly thereafter, the human era will be ended." Vinge refines his estimate of the time scales involved, adding, "I'll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030."</p> <p>Vinge continues by predicting that superhuman intelligences, however created, will be able to enhance their own minds faster than the humans that created them. "When greater-than-human intelligence drives progress," Vinge writes, "that progress will be much more rapid." This feedback loop of self-improving intelligence, he predicts, will cause large amounts of technological progress within a short period of time.</p> <p>Most proposed methods for creating smarter-than-human or transhuman minds fall into one of two categories: intelligence amplification of human brains and artificial intelligence. The means speculated to produce intelligence augmentation are numerous, and include bio- and genetic engineering, nootropic drugs, AI assistants, direct brain-computer interfaces, and mind transfer.</p> <p>Despite the numerous speculated means for amplifying human intelligence, non-human artificial intelligence (specifically seed AI) is the most popular option for organizations trying to advance the singularity, a choice addressed by Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (2002). Hanson (1998) is also skeptical of human intelligence augmentation, writing that once one has exhausted the "low-hanging fruit" of easy methods for increasing human intelligence, further improvements will become increasingly difficult to find.</p> <p>It is difficult to directly compare silicon-based hardware with neurons. But Berglas (2008) notes that computer speech recognition is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude as powerful as the human brain.</p> <p>One other factor potentially hastening the singularity is the ongoing expansion of the community working on it, resulting from the increase in scientific research within developing countries.</p> <p><a name="Economic_aspects" id="Economic_aspects"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Economic aspects</span></span></h3> <p>Dramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because of some technological advancement. Based on population growth, the economy doubled every 250,000 years from the Paleolithic era until the Neolithic Revolution. This new agricultural economy began to double every 900 years, a remarkable increase. In the current era, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the world&#8217;s economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster than in the agricultural era. If the rise of superhuman intelligences causes a similar revolution, one would expect the economy to double at least quarterly and possibly on a weekly basis.</p> <p>Machines capable of performing most mental and physical tasks as well as humans would cause a rise in wages for the jobs at which humans can still outperform machines. However, a sudden proliferation of humanlike machines would likely cause a net drop in wages, as humans compete with robots for jobs. Also, the wealth of the technological singularity may be concentrated in the hands of only a few. These wealthy few would be those who own the means of mass producing the intelligent robot workforce.</p> <p><a name="Potential_dangers" id="Potential_dangers"></a></p> <h3><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);font-size:100%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Potential dangers</span></span></h3> <p>Superhuman intelligences may have goals inconsistent with human survival and prosperity. AI researcher Hugo de Garis suggests AIs may simply eliminate the human race, and humans would be powerless to stop them.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Singularity#CITEREFBerglas2008" title=""></a>Berglas (2008) argues that unlike man, a computer based intelligence is not tied to any particular body, which would give it a radically different world view. In particular, a software intelligence would essentially be immortal and so have no need to produce independent children that live on after it dies. It would thus have no evolutionary need for love.</p> <p>Other oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology and genetic engineering. These threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics, and were the subject of Bill Joy's Wired magazine article "Why the future doesn't need us" (Joy 2000).</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Singularity#CITEREFBostrom2002" title=""></a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Bostrom (2002) discusses human extinction scenarios, and lists superintelligence as a possible cause:</span></p> <blockquote> <p>When we create the first superintelligent entity, we might make a mistake and give it goals that lead it to annihilate humankind, assuming its enormous intellectual advantage gives it the power to do so. For example, we could mistakenly elevate a subgoal to the status of a supergoal. We tell it to solve a mathematical problem, and it complies by turning all the matter in the solar system into a giant calculating device, in the process killing the person who asked the question. <br /></p></blockquote><span><span>Moravec (1992) argues that although superintelligence in th</span></span>e form of machines may make humans in some sense obsolete as the top intelligence, there will still be room in the ecology for humans. <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky" title="Eliezer Yudkowsky"></a><span><span>Eliezer Yudkowsky proposed that research be undertaken to produce friendly artificial intelligence in order to address the dangers. He noted that if the first real AI was friendly it would have a head start on self-improvement and thus might prevent other unfriendly AIs from developing. The Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence is dedicated to this cause. Bill Hibbard also addresses issues of AI safety and morality in his book Super-Intelligent Machines. However, Berglas (2008) notes that there is no direct evolutionary motivation for an AI to be friendly to man.</span></span></p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov"></a><span><span>Isaac Asimov&#8217;s Three Laws of Robotics are one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI. The laws are intended to prevent artificially intelligent robots from harming humans. In Asimov&#8217;s stories, any perceived problems with the laws tend to arise as a result of a misunderstanding on the part of some human operator; the robots themselves are merely acting to their best interpretation of their rules. In the 2004 film I, Robot, a possibility is explored in which AI take complete control over humanity for the purpose of protecting humanity from itself. (The movie was based loosely on Asimov's stories; the aspect of machines taking over bears closer resemblance to Capek's R.U.R., the first novel ever to use the term robot.) In 2004, the Singularity Institute launched an Internet campaign called 3 Laws Unsafe to raise awareness of AI safety issues and the inadequacy of Asimov&#8217;s laws in particular (Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence 2004).</span></span></p> <p>Man<span><span>y Singularitarians consider nanotechnology to be one of the greatest dangers facing humanity. For this reason, they often believe seed AI (an AI capable of making itself smarter) should precede nanotechnology. Others, such as the Foresight Institute, advocate efforts to create molecular nanotechnology, claiming nanotechnology can be made safe for pre-singularity use or can expedite the arrival of a beneficial singularity.</span></span></p><p><br /></p> <p><a name="Accelerating_change" id="Accelerating_change"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Accelerating change</span></span></h2> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width: 227px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg" class="image" title="Kurzweil writes that, due to paradigm shifts, a trend of exponential growth extends from integrated circuits to earlier transistors, vacuum tubes, relays and electromechanical computers."><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/PPTMooresLawai.jpg/225px-PPTMooresLawai.jpg" class="thumbimage" width="225" border="0" height="226" /></a> <div class="thumbcaption">  Kurzweil writes that, due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift" title="Paradigm shift"></a>paradigm shifts, a trend of exponential growth extends from integrated circuits to earlier transistors, vacuum tubes, relays and electromechanical computers.<br /><br /></div> </div> </div> <div class="thumb tright"> <div class="thumbinner" style="width: 402px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kscaleprojections.png" class="image" title="Various Kardashev scale projections through 2100.

One results in a singularity.</div> </div> </div>  <p>Some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology. In one of the first uses of the term "singularity" in the context of technological progress, Ulam (1958) tells of a conversation with John von Neumann about accelerating change:</p> <blockquote> <p>One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Singularity#CITEREFHawkins1983" title=""></a>Hawkins (1983) writes that "mindsteps", dramatic and irreversible changes to paradigms or world views, are accelerating in frequency as quantified in his mindstep equation. He cites the inventions of writing, mathematics, and the computer as examples of such changes.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" title="Ray Kurzweil" class="mw-redirect"></a>Ray Kurzweil's analysis of history concludes that technological progress follows a pattern of exponential growth, following what he calls The Law of Accelerating Returns. He generalizes Moore's Law, which describes geometric growth in integrated semiconductor complexity, to include technologies from far before the integrated circuit.</p> <p>Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil writes, new technologies will cross it. He pred<span><span>icts paradigm shifts will become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history" (Kurzweil 2001). Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century, setting the date at 2045 (Kurzweil 2005). His </span></span>predictions differ from Vinge&#8217;s in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather than Vinge&#8217;s rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.</p> <p>This leads to the conclusion that an artificial intelligence that is capable of improving on its own design is also faced with a singularity. This idea is explored by Dan Simmons in his novel Hyperion, where a collection of artificial intelligences debate whether or not to make themselves obsolete by creating a new generation of "ultimate" intelligence.</p> <p>The Acceleration Studies Foundation, an educational non-profit foundation founded by John Smart, engages in outreach, education, research and advocacy concerning accelerating change (Acceleration Studies Foundation 2007). It produces the Accelerating Change conference at Stanford University, and maintains the educational site Acceleration Watch.</p> <p>Presumably, a technological singularity would lead to a rapid development of a Kardashev Type I civilization where a Kardashev Type I civilization has achieved mastery of the resources of its home planet, Type II of its planetary system, and Type III of its galaxy. Given the fact that, depending on the calculations used, humans on Earth will reach 0.7 on the Kardashev scale by 2040 or sooner, a technological singularity between now and then would push us rapidly over that limit.</p><p><br /></p> <p><a name="Criticism" id="Criticism"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></span></h2> <p>Some critics assert that no computer or machine will ever achieve human intelligence while others do not rule out the possibility. Theodore Modis and Jonathan Huebner argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. John Smart criticizes Huebner's analysis. Some evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer clock speeds is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold. Although clock speeds in the past were advertised as the main source of speed from a processor, that's no longer true. Today's processors use the circuits for different, more efficient purposes than pushing raw clock speed. For instance, a Core i7 at 2 GHz is far more powerful than a Pentium 4 at 4 GHz.</p> <p>Others propose that other "singularities" can be found through analysis of trends in world population, world GDP, and other indices. Andrey Korotayev and others argue that historical hyperbolic growth curves can be attributed to feedback loops that ceased to affect global trends in the 1970s, and thus hyperbolic growth should not be expected in the future.</p> <p>In <i>The Progress of Computing</i>, William Nordhaus argued that, prior to 1940, computers followed the much slower growth of a traditional industrial economy, thus rejecting extrapolations of Moore's Law to 19th-century computers. Schmidhuber (2006) suggests differences in memory of recent and distant events create an illusion of accelerating change, and that such phenomena may be responsible for past apocalyptic predictions.</p> <p>A recent study of patents per thousand persons shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact&#8212;as suggested by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter" title="Joseph Tainter"></a>Joseph Tainter in his seminal The Collapse of Complex Societies&#8212;a law of diminishing returns. The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850&#8211;1900, and has been declining since. The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a wide spread "general systems collapse". Thomas Homer Dixon in The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization shows that the declining energy returns on investment has led to the collapse of civilizations. Jared Diamond in Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed also shows that cultures self-limit when they exceed the sustainable carrying capacity of their environment, and the consumption of strategic resources (frequently timber, soils or water) creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression.</p><p><br /></p> <p><a name="Popular_culture" id="Popular_culture"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" ><span class="mw-headline">Popular culture</span></span></h2><p>While discussing the singularity's growing recognition, Vinge (1993) writes that "it was the science-fiction writers who felt the first concrete impact." In addition to his own short story "Bookworm, Run!", whose protagonist is a chimpanzee with intelligence augmented by a government experiment, he cites Greg Bear's novel Blood Music (1983) as an example of the singularity in fiction. In William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer, AIs capable of improving their own programs are strictly regulated by special "Turing police" to ensure they never exceed a certain level of intelligence, and the plot centers on the efforts of one such AI to circumvent their control. The 1994 novel The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect features an AI that augments itself so quickly as to gain low-level control of all matter in the Universe in a matter of hours. A more malevolent AI achieves similar levels of omnipotence in Harlan Ellison's short story I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (1967). William Thomas Quick's novels Dreams of Flesh and Sand (1988), Dreams of Gods and Men (1989), and Singularities (1990) present an account of the transition through the singularity; in the latter novel, one of the characters states that it is necessary for Mankind's survival that they achieve an integration with the emerging machine intelligences, or it will be crushed under the dominance of the machines &#8211; the greatest risk to the survival of a species reaching this point (and alluding to large numbers of other species that either survived or failed this test, although no actual contact with alien species occurs in the novels).</p> <p>The singularity is sometimes addressed in fictional works to explain the event's absence. Neal Asher's Gridlinked series features a future where humans living in the Polity are governed by AIs and while some are resentful, most believe that they are far better governors than any human. In the fourth novel, Polity Agent, it is mentioned that the singularity is far overdue yet most AIs have decided not to partake in it for reasons that only they know. A flashback character in Ken MacLeod's 1998 novel The Cassini Division dismissively refers to the singularity as "the Rapture for nerds", though the singularity goes on to happen anyway.</p> <p>Popular movies in which computers become intelligent and overpower the human race include <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project" title="Colossus: The Forbin Project"></a></i>Colossus: The Forbin Project, the Terminator series, I, Robot, and The Matrix series. The television series Battlestar Galactica also explores these themes.</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov"></a>Isaac Asimov expressed ideas similar to a post-Kurzweilian singularity in his short story The Last Question. Asimov's future envisions a reality where a combination of strong artificial intelligence and post-humans consume the cosmos, during a time Kurzweil describes as when "the universe wakes up", the last of his six stages of cosmic evolution as described in The Singularity is Near. Post-human entities throughout various time periods of the story inquire of the artificial intelligence within the story as to how entropy death will be avoided. The AI responds that it lacks sufficient information to come to a conclusion, until the end of the story when the AI does indeed arrive at a solution, and demonstrates it by re-creating the universe, in godlike speech and fashion, from scratch. Notably, it does so in order to fulfill its duty to answer the humans' question.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Edward%27s_University" title="St. Edward's University"></a>St. Edward's University chemist Eamonn Healy discusses accelerating change in the film Waking Life. He divides history into increasingly shorter periods, estimating "two billion years for life, six million years for the hominid, a hundred-thousand years for mankind as we know it". He proceeds to human cultural evolution, giving time scales of ten thousand years for agriculture, four hundred years for the scientific revolution, and one hundred fifty years for the industrial revolution. Information is emphasized as providing the basis for the new evolutionary paradigm, with artificial intelligence its culmination. He concludes we will eventually create "neohumans" which will usurp humanity&#8217;s present role in scientific and technological progress and allow the exponential trend of accelerating change to continue past the limits of human ability.</p> <p>Accelerating progress features in some science fiction works, and is a central theme in Charles Stross's Accelerando. Other notable authors that address singularity-related issues include Karl Schroeder, Greg Egan, Ken MacLeod, David Brin, Iain M. Banks, Neal Stephenson, Tony Ballantyne, Bruce Sterling, Dan Simmons, Damien Broderick, Fredric Brown, Jacek Dukaj, Nagaru Tanigawa and Cory Doctorow. Another relevant work is Warren Ellis&#8217; ongoing comic book series newuniversal.</p> <p>In the episode "The Turk" of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, John Connor mentions the singularity. The Terminator franchise is predicated on the concept of a human-designed computer system becoming self-aware and deciding to destroy humankind. It eventually achieves superintelligence.</p> <p>In the film Screamers&#8212;based on Philip K. Dick's short story Second Variety&#8212;mankind's own weapons begin to design and assemble themselves. Self replicating machines (here, the screamers) are often considered to be a significant prerequisite "final phase"&#8212;almost like a catalyst to the accelerating progress leading to a singularity. Interestingly, screamers develop to a level where they will kill each other and one even professes her love for the human. This idea is common in Dick's stories, that explore beyond the simplistic "man vs machine" scenario in which our creations consider us a threat.</p> <p>The feature-length documentary film<span style="font-style: italic;"> Transcendent Man </span>is based on Ray Kurzweil and his book <i>The Singularity Is Near</i>. The film documents Kurzweil's quest to reveal what he believes to be mankind's destiny.</p> <p>On his album <i>People of Earth</i>, Dr. Steel has a song by the title of "The Singularity."</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

General Motors uses around 16,000 robots for tasks such as painting, welding, and assembly. Japan is the leader in using and producing robots in the world.

This prospered greatly with the Digital Revolution, and helped introduce people, especially children, to a life of dealing with various types of AI, specifically in the form of Tamagotchis and Giga Pets, the Internet (example: basic search engine interfaces are one simple form), and the first widely released robot, Furby. A mere year later an improved type of domestic robot was released in the form of Aibo, a robotic dog with intelligent features and autonomy. AI has also been applied to video games.</p><p><br /></p> <p><a name="Music" id="Music"></a></p> <h2><span class="editsection"></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:130%;" > <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></span></h2> <p>The evolution of music has always been affected by technology.

The AOD has use for artificial intelligence for surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.</p> <p>The use of artificial intelligence in simulators is proving to be very useful for the AOD. Airplane simulators are using artificial intelligence in order to process the data taken from simulated flights. Other than simulated flying, there is also simulated aircraft warfare. The computers are able to come up with the best success scenarios in these situations. The computers can also create strategies based on the placement, size, speed, and strength of the forces and counter forces. Pilots may be given assistance in the air during combat by computers. The artificial intelligent programs can sort the information and provide the pilot with the best possible maneuvers, not to mention getting rid of certain maneuvers that would be impossible for a sentient being to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations so computer simulated pilots are used to gather data. These computer simulated pilots are also used to train future air traffic controllers.</p> <p>The system used by the AOD in order to measure performance was the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS. It is a rule based expert system put together by collecting information from TF-30 documents and the expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used to for the development of the TF-30 for the RAAF F-111C. The performance system was also used to replace specialized workers. The system allowed the regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers.</p> <p>The AOD also uses artificial intelligence in speech recognition software. The air traffic controllers are giving directions to the artificial pilots and the AOD wants to the pilots to respond to the ATC&#8217;s with simple responses. The programs that incorporate the speech software must be trained, which means they use neural networks. The program used, the Verbex 7000, is still a very early program that has plenty of room for improvement. The improvements are imperative because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time.</p> <p>The Artificial Intelligence supported Design of Aircraft, or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective.</p> <p>In 2003, NASA&#8217;s Dryden Flight Research Center, and many other companies, created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing zone can be reached. The Intelligent Flight Control System was tested on an F-15, which was heavily modified by NASA. The software compensates for all the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components. The neural network used in the software proved to be effective and marked a triumph for artificial intelligence.</p> <p>The Integrated Vehicle Health Management system, also used by NASA, on board an aircraft must process and interpret data taken from the various sensors on the aircraft. The system needs to be able to determine the structural integrity of the aircraft.

			  <h4>"Second Order Cybernetics Then and Now"</h4>
			  <p>The 2013 Heinz von Foerster Lecture will be given by Stuart Umpleby professor of management at George Washington University at the University of Vienna on Monday 18th November 2013, 19.00 Lecture Room 13.</p><p>Prof Umplelby writes: When Heinz von Foerster coined the term "second order cybernetics", his goal was to include the observer in the domain of science.  This was a fundamental change in the conception of science, and Heinz encountered stiff opposition.  One consequence of including the observer would be to extend cybernetics (and science) into the domain of ethics.  Scientists had previously sought to be objective.  Including the observer made science a subjective enterprise.  This suggestion was strongly resisted by Heinz's colleagues in the UIUC College of Engineering and elsewhere in the U.S. academic community....Several conceptions of second order science have now been formulated. If we use the correspondence principle (i.e., every new theory should reduce to the old theory to which it corresponds for those cases in which the old theory is known to hold), we can say that two dimensions have been added to the conception of science:  a) amount of attention paid to the observer, and b) the amount of effect of a theory on the phenomenon described.</p><p><a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/zeitgeschichte/18-11-heinz-von-foerster-lecture-13/">Further Information</a>.</p><hr/>

			  <h4>OLKC 2014 Theme: "Circuits of Knowledge" Oslo 22-24 April 2014</h4><p>The organisers write:"With the proposed theme "Circuits of knowledge" we hope the conference contributions may be inspired to further develop the organizational learning, knowledge and innovation literature through conceptual and empirical contributions. The metaphor is meant to open up explorations of how knowledge and organizational learning may be said to move or revolve around, in, and through circuits. Familiar concepts may be learning cycles and -loops, and the recursiveness of practice."</p><p><a href="http://www.olkc2014.com/">Further details</a>.</p><hr/>

			  <h4>Doug Engelbart</h4><p>From <a href="http://hermes.circ.gwu.edu/archives/cybcom.html">CYBCOM</a> Randall Whitaker writes:"I'm sad to learn that Doug Engelbart has died, though I knew he'd been in frail health for some time.</p><p>

"There are very, very few individuals to whom I've accorded unabashed admiration (i.e. 'personal hero' status).  Doug was one of them.
</p><p>
"In spring 1991 I organized a study tour for Swedish IT and telecommunications professionals focusing on computer-mediated collaboration and collaborative technologies.  A group of 25 - 30, subdivided into roving teams, visited a variety of R&D centers across North America.  The centerpiece of the tour was a 3-day mini-conference at a resort in Tucson, for which we deliberately scheduled a single featured guest - Doug Engelbart.  I had pushed for this based on my claim that research efforts at CERN (i.e. Tim Berners-Lee and company ...) held the promise of bringing Engelbart's ideas to widespread fruition.
</p><p>
"In his demonstrations (using some of his innovative equipment dating back decades) and two days of casual conversations, Engelbart showed us more of the future than we had garnered from all the other research visits combined.  Even now - more than two decades later - I don't think I've ever seen anyone surf so much data so quickly and so effectively as this already-aged man did with his chord keyboard and antiquated electromechanical mouse.  Even now the Web has yet to widely exploit the full extent of the hypertextual features he and his SRI colleagues built into their early NLS / AUGMENT systems.  
</p><p>
"The cursory references to Engelbart as the originator of the mouse don't do justice to the full range of his (and his colleagues') insights, innovations, and vision.  The SRI research wasn't just the seminal source for our current human-computer interaction modalities - it was also the primary inspiration for the Web as well as the everyday utility of the 'Net in general.
</p><p>
"This is why I jumped out of my poolside seat and walked over to greet him when he arrived at the Tucson resort.  I introduced myself, shook his hand, and simply / earnestly said, "On behalf of more people than you may know - thank you!"
</p><p>
"Doug Engelbart was not only a significant visionary - he was by far the most generous and gracious visionary I've ever encountered.
</p><p>
"If you've never seen the 1968 presentation at which Engelbart and his SRI colleagues demonstrated the technological products of their research into augmenting human intelligence, I heartily recommend you do so.  I don't know of any other single recorded event at which so much of so much significance was unveiled.  
</p><p>
"I've long made this video mandatory viewing for students and colleagues - if for no other reason to illustrate that everything they began engaging as the Web circa 1993 had been demonstrated a quarter century earlier.  Recognition of this protracted latency is both disconcerting and humbling."

              <h4>The Whole Earth: California and the Disappearance of the Outside<br />
              Exhibition 26th April 2013 to the 1st July 2013 Haus der Kulturen der Welt,
              Berlin</h4>

              <p>The exhibition and conference project emerges from the context of
              cultural and scientific debates about the Anthropocene to investigate basic
              questions of the "age of man", as well as negotiating the historical
              relation between ecology and cybernetics. The exhibition project departs
              from a particular moment in time: California of the 1960s and 70s.
              California was not only a centre of the counterculture with its global
              impact on music and other cultural productions, but also a laboratory
              fusing diverse mind-sets and ideologies which influenced the current
              "ecological paradigm" and "systems thinking".</p>

              <p>Using materials from cultural history and artistic works, the exhibition
              will critically explore the application of ecological-systemic concepts to
              society, politics, and aesthetics. The transformation of romantic and
              technophile ideas from the realm of counterculture and cybernetics led to
              concepts of the system and self-management in network capitalism that have
              a global impact today.</p>

              <p>The Haus der Kulturen der Welt is an interdisciplinary space for
              international contemporary arts and a forum for current developments and
              discourse in Berlin. Throughout the years, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt
              has ensured the development of a strong network of intercultural
              co-operations with institutions and actors of the cultural and artistic
              fields, offering them optimal conditions of presentation.</p>

              <h4>"The Cybernetics of Self-Organisation, Learning and Evolution" Papers
              1960-1972 by Gordon Pask selected and introduced by Bernard Scott.</h4>

              <p>Pask's learned papers are notoriously hard to get. There are 15 papers
              here from for the early years including two previously unpublshed: "Some
              mechanical Concepts of Goals, Individuals, Consciousness and Symbolic
              Evolution" and "Essays on the Ethics and Aesthetics of Control". Neither is
              trivial both are long substantial papers like the others in this fine
              collection. In his forward Karl H. Mueller calls Pask "The Hidden Grand
              Master of Cybernetics" this says it all. You will not find system analysis
              done like this anywhere else. Dip in before you get started, you may need a
              pad and pencil, but you will be intrigued and above all stimulated with
              this fresh new take starting 52 years ago.</p>

              <p>If you need reassurance look at some of the more familiar questions
              discussed here like McCulloch's Redundancty of Potential Command (condition
              for self-organisation) and von Foerster's development of it. Tucked away in
              "Man as a System that Needs to Learn", page 280, is a discussion of this
              which <a href="http://www.nickgreen.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/GPprog.PDF">Pask
              claimed</a> motivated his production of Conversation Theory and the later
              Interactions of Actors Theory.</p>

              <p>The P-Individual and its medium the M-Individual reach full flower by
              the end of the collection accompanied by sundry "good ideas" waiting for
              further development. Type I and Type II analogies, extensive discussions of
              the nature of "goal" and his L<sup>0</sup>, L<sup>1</sup> and L<sup>*</sup>
              languages come to mind. Particularly striking, in his "Comments on the
              Cybernetics of Ethical, Sociological, Psychological Systems", are four
              types of Law appled by arbitrators, each new type dependent on the
              existence of the preceeding type.</p>

              <p>Papers selected:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>The Natural History of Networks</li>

              <p>There is much treasure in Scott's collection and as Pask's most
              sustained collaborator he is to be congratulated on his choices and his

              <h4>An Ecology of Ideas: ASC and BIG at Asilomar, California, 9-13 July
              2012</h4>

              <p>The American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) and Bateson Idea Group (BIG)
              come together to hold a conference on the relations among ideas as seen
              from multiple perspectives. We come from many disciplines but have common
              roots including cybernetics, circularity, reflexivity, language, culture

              <h4>Cybernetic Revolutionaries- Technology and Politics in Allende's Chile
              by Eden Medina<br />
              MIT Press ISBN-13:978-0-262-01649-0</h4>

              <p>Prof Raul Espejo, who was Operational Director of Project Cybersyn,
              <a href="http://syncho2.blogspot.co.uk/">reviews the book</a>.</p>

              <p>From the publishers: A history of two intersecting utopian visions, one
              political and one technological. The first was Chile's experiment with
              peaceful socialist change under Salvador Allende; the second was the
              simultaneous attempt to build a computer system that would manage Chile's
              economy. Neither vision was fully realized--Allende's government ended with
              a violent military coup; the system, known as Project Cybersyn, was never
              completely implemented--but they hold lessons for today about the
              relationship between technology and politics.</p>

              <p>This history further shows how human attempts to combine the political
              and the technological with the goal of creating a more just society can
              open new technological, intellectual, and political possibilities.
              Technologies, Medina writes, are historical texts; when we read them we are
              reading history.</p>

              Boston March 2014</h4>

              <p>IEEE write: During his life Dr Norbert Wiener influenced mathematics,
              philosophy, science, technology, ethics, biology, prosthetics, education,
              manufacturing and other fields. Cyberspace is named after his
              multidisciplinary approach, "cybernetics". He was an early practitioner of
              diversity and social inclusion, and an advocate of social responsibility in
              the development of technology. This conference will look at his ideas and
              the influence they have today.</p>

              <p>It is part of a renewed interest in Dr Wiener's work, an interest that
              is being reflected in research, writing and practice, and in both old and
              new media.</p>

              <h4>Call for papers, 11th International Conference of
              Sociocybernetics<br />
              Complexity and Social Action: Interaction and Multiple Systems<br />
              2- 6 of July, Algarve University, Faro, Portugal</h4>

              <p>Recent events throughout the globe have put into perspective the need
              for new theory settings, new approaches and new insights into the current
              social dynamics that many consider on a verge of rupture. Financial crises,
              social uprisings, forced governmental collapses, and increasing
              inequalities within several spheres of the social world are some of the
              events that necessarily put collective and individual social action into
              new perspectives.</p>

              <p>It is no longer possible to think of social phenomena in a disconnected
              way, since their foundations and limits are not clear. The understanding of
              social action and interaction, as cause and consequence of social
              phenomenon, depends on the capacity to consider and analyze all
              possibilities in action systems, their diversity and relations integrating
              micro, macro and meso perspectives. It is therefore, imperative for the
              sociocybernetic approach to address such a challenge.</p>

              <p>The study of the interaction between multiple systems can be a useful
              and sound new way of thinking, especially if it follows a transdisciplinary
              approach. From the variety of subjects relevant in this respect, the next
              RC51 2012 Conference in Faro, will emphasize the following:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Decision Making and Action: Decision making is a highly complex
                embodied process resulting from the concerted action of a diverse set of
                interconnected systems that allow for the development of social action
                under the uncertainty that the future holds. Under this theme, we intend
                to explore the complexity of the intra-systemic and inter-systemic
                pathways framing decision-making and subsequent social action.</li>

                <li>Violence: Violence is an interconnected system, socially and
                culturally produced and reproduced, and therefore embedded in
                individuals, institutions and states. The production of violence is a
                phenomenon with deep interconnections between the social, cultural,
                biological, emotional and symbolic systems. The discussion between the
                articulation of the individual system (composed of
                responses/actions/reactions/interactions), and the social and cultural
                system which provide the actor with the symbolic, and many times,
                unconscious tolls of actions and interactions, is crucial to advance the
                production of knowledge in this area.</li>

                <li>Social Movements: The new social movements, now emerging in many
                countries, with different levels of economic development, combine a
                variety of new dimensions that exceed previously sociologically
                knowledge. The sociological analysis of these movements' actions
                requires, primarily, an intersystem approach of the complexity of all its
                dimensions, and secondly, two other dimensions of the social actors'
                selves: the relationship between themselves and the relationship that
                each social actor wants to have with old and new groups, organizations
                and institutions.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>Papers are welcomed which address these issues. Beyond that other papers
              addressing conceptual and theoretical issues in sociocybernetics or
              reporting relevant empirical findings are also welcomed.</p>

              <p>President of the American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) Dr Ranulph
              Glanville writes: The EMCSR (European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems
              Research) conference series was founded in 1972. At the last meeting in
              2010, Robert Trappl, who had chaired it since its beginning, retired. The
              new chair, Wolfgang Hofkirchner, who directs the Bertalanffy Archive in
              Vienna, has just published the outline program for next spring's
              conference.</p>

              <p>There are changes in how the conference will be run. For instance, round
              table discussions are welcome. There will be a pre and post doc colloquium.
              There are new symposia and symposium chairs. And the process for submission
              and publication is different, with extended abstracts for proposals, and
              papers written in final form after the conference, for publication.</p>

              <p>Please note the symposia (look under programme &gt;&gt; symposia). Apart
              from symposium E, chaired by Karl Mueller and myself, there are other
              symposia that cover a wide range of different approaches and areas.</p>

              <p>I invite you all to have a look at the programme and, if you find the
              conference interesting, exciting and/or relevant, to make arrangements to
              be there. Check out the <a href="http://www.emcsr.net">web site</a>. Vienna
              is lovely in mid-April.</p>

              <p>At the same time, let me advise you of the American Society for
              Cybernetics' conference, 9 to 13 July, at Asilomar State Park Conference
              Centre, California, to be held in conjunction with the Bateson Idea Group.
              This promises to be a richly interesting event, and will remind us that
              there many sources of today's cybernetics, and many ways forward. This
              conference is in the week before the ISSS conference at San Jose: we are
              planing a special, reduced rate for those attending both. The conference
              web site will be launched in the new year, and will be accessible through
              the <a href="http://www.asc-cybernetics.org">ASC home page</a>.</p>

              <h4>A new book by a Member of Council of the Society</h4>

              <h4>Bernard Scott "Explorations in Second-Order Cybernetics: Reflections on
              Cybernetics,Psychology and Education"</h4>

              <p><img align="left" src="Bern%20Book.jpg" alt=
              "Explorations in Second-Order Cybernetics" />Dr Scott worked for ten years
              with Gordon Pask and practised in schools, psychology, technology and
              higher education. He says cybernetics "transformed my way of being in the
              world".</p>

              <p>Ranulph Glanvile, president of the American Cybernetics Society,
              writes:"...It presents his retelling of work he did with Pask, and work he
              has done since. His own solo work demonstrates how significant a
              contributor he was to Pask and how his [Scott's] understandings have their
              own value, which is sometimes, but only sometimes, placed in the service of
              Pask.... It is a wonderful collection. Each paper is a gem, showing the
              mind of an exceptionally decent and gifted academic behaving - and thinking
              - with fairness and flair. I hope that each reader will enjoy, and benefit
              from it, as much as I have."</p>

              <h4>Nicholas Shaxson's "Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men who Stole
              the World"</h4>

              <p>Sequester Offshore Funds? Shaxson estimates around 25% of <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product">Gross World Product</a>
              (GWP- around $41 trillion) or $10 trillion is held in secret Offshore bank
              accounts owned by banks, multinational companies, <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy">kleptocrats</a>, terrorists,
              drug traffickers and ordinary individuals. Client confidentiality protects
              from tax authority investigation. This is the undiscussed component of the
              current and any future economic crisis.</p>

              <p>International Authorities might, at the very least, agree improved
              performance reporting for governments and enterprises of all kinds as
              recommended by International Auditors in <a href=
              "http://www.globalpublicpolicysymposium.com/CEO_Vision.pdf">Global Capital
              Markets and the Global Economy</a> at their 2006 Paris Global Public Policy
              Symposium.</p>

              <p>The confidence of tax-payers and investors can only be maintained with
              real-time web based reporting particularly given the current crisis. The
              cybernetics is plain and simple: systems that are not properly instrumented
              will go out of control.</p>

              2011.</h4>

              <p>Gerhard Gr&ouml;ssing, Albert M&uuml;ller and Karl H. M&uuml;ller write:
              Again, the University of Vienna will be the venue of discussions on the
              efforts as well as the effects of Heinz von Foerster's work and life.</p>

              <p>It is only one of the special aims of this year&Acirc;&rsquo;s
              conference to celebrate von Foerster's 100th birthday. As to celebrating
              his work, we deem it appropriate to start with implications of Heinz von
              Foerster's early works, as represented by his early quantum-physical
              interpretation of memory and by his seminal work on self-organizing systems
              in the early 1960ies. Accordingly, this tear's conference moves along two
              quite different and- nevertheless- related tracks.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Emergent Quantum Mechanics (primarily targeted audience: physicists);

                (primarily targeted audience: specialists in sciences and humanities, and
                a general audience); convened by Albert M&uuml;ller and Karl H.
                M&uuml;ller</li>
              </ul>

              be updated permanently throughout the next months)</p>

              <p>The conference will take place at the main building of the University of
              Vienna from 10th to 13th November 2011. There will be special seminars
              before and after the conference, and a series of documentary films on
              topics related to cybernetics to be seen at a Viennese cinema.</p>

              <h4>American Cybernetics Society 2011 Conference: "Listening"</h4>

              <p>ASC president Dr. Ranulph Glanville writes: We regard listening as the
              key act that turns talking into conversation. However, we use these words
              metaphorically, and not just literally: we do not mean to concentrate on
              the aural senses, but on the idea that it is the recipient who gives
              meaning to what they hear. This is how they release the potential in a
              statement made by another into conversation, whether the conversation is in
              words, acts, gestures, or indeed any other medium of communication. This
              can lead to the development of understanding of the other so important in
              human relations (perhaps specially in fields such as psycho-therapy,
              management, education and music).</p>

              <p>Our conference is organised around informal and generous conversations
              in small groups, but has space for formal paper presentations and
              performances. We are also inviting experiential workshops. The conference
              itself will be held in Richmond, Indiana, USA, and begins in the evening of
              10 August and runs to the evening of 13 August 2001. There is a sliding
              scale of charges. For those attending, there are free add-on events before
              and after.</p>

              <h4>Reform of Banking IT vital for better regulation</h4>

              <p>From The Economist July 22nd 2010: The software used by Banks appears to
              be an ad hoc fragile mix of patches with no robust design philosophy. One
              "dyed-in-the-wool entrepreneur" is reported as saying he hates programmers
              as they only cause trouble. No doubt screams of horror from experts can and
              should cause trouble for incompetent banking executives whose ignorance of

              <h4>Lovelock changes his mind mind on Global Warming?</h4>

              <p>Quoted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Rutan">Bert
              Rutan</a> in slide 84 of his <a href=
              "http://rps3.com/Pages/Burt_Rutan_on_Climate_Change.htm">An Engineer's
              Critique of Global Warming "Science"</a>:</p>

              <p>Dr. James Lovelock in March 2010: At London's Science Museum Dr Lovelock
              said: "If we hadn't appeared on the earth, it would be due to go through
              another ice age... greenhouse gases that have warmed the planet are likely
              to prevent a big freeze... .We're just fiddling around. It is worth
              thinking that what we are doing in creating all these carbon emissions, far
              from being something frightful, is stopping the onset of a new ice age...we
              can look at our part as holding that up...I hate all this business about
              feeling guilty about what we're doing... . We're not guilty, we never
              intended to pump CO2 into the atmosphere, it's just something we did."</p>

              <p>He compared today's climate change controversy to the "wildly
              inaccurate" early work on aerosol gases and their alleged role in depletion
              of the ozone layer: "Quite often, observations done by hand are accurate
              but all the theoretical stuff in between tends to be very dodgy and I think
              they are seeing this with climate change... .We haven't learned the lessons
              of the ozone-hole debate. It's important to know just how much you have got
              to be careful"</p>

              <p>"I think you have to accept that the skeptics have kept us sane... .
              They have been a breath of fresh air. They have kept us from regarding the
              science of climate change as a religion. It has gone too far that way.
              There is a role for skeptics in science. They shouldn't be brushed aside.
              It is clear that the 'angel side' wasn't without sin".</p>

              <h4>Andrew Pickering: "The Cybernetic Brain: Sketches of Another
              Future"</h4>

              <p>From the publishers: Cybernetics - roughly, the study of systems - is
              often thought of as a grim science of control. But as <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Pickering">Andrew Pickering</a>
              reveals in this beguiling book, a much more lively and experimental strain
              of cybernetics can be traced from the 1940s to the present. "The Cybernetic
              Brain" explores a largely forgotten group of British thinkers, including
              Grey Walter, Ross Ashby, Gregory Bateson, R. D. Laing, Stafford Beer, and
              Gordon Pask, and their singular work in a dazzling array of fields.
              Psychiatry, engineering, management, politics, music, architecture,
              education, tantric yoga, the Beats, and the '60s counterculture all come
              into play as Pickering follows the history of cybernetics' impact on the
              world, from contemporary robotics and complexity theory to the Chilean
              economy under Salvador Allende. What underpins this fascinating history,
              Pickering contends, is a shared but unconventional vision of the world as
              ultimately unknowable, a place where genuine novelty is always emerging.
              Thus, Pickering avers, the history of cybernetics provides us with an
              imaginative model of open-ended experimentation in stark opposition to the
              modern urge to achieve domination over nature and each other.</p>

              <h4>Three recent books</h4>

              <h5>Think before you Think</h5>

              <p>This first is a most important collection of papers and unpublished
              writings of Stafford Beer edited by David Whittaker (author of "<a href=
              "http://www.wavestonepress.co.uk/photo_934703.html">Stafford Beer: a
              personal memoir</a>"). Contents include "The Laws of Anarchy", "The Will of
              the People", Beer's own reflections on his famous Viable System Model,
              extracts from the unfinished autobiography from which the collection takes
              its title and a selection of Beer's poetry and paintings. Simply put this
              is required reading for cyberneticians. The general reader is well
              supported with the editor's Appendix C "Cybernetics in a Nutshell". "Think
              before you Think: Social Complexity and Knowledge of Knowing" Edited by
              David Whittaker, Foreword by Brian Eno. ISBN 9780954519469 <a href=

              <h5>SuperFreakonomics</h5>

              <p>Levitt and Dubner examine the homeostats of perverse economic incentive
              in, for example, prostitution, suicide bombing, altruism, cheap solutions
              to big problems (including hospital acquired infections), and global
              cooling. There is never a dull moment in this witty and innovative
              quantitative economic analysis that repeats the earlier success of
              "Freakonomics" (Charlie Rose <a href=
              "http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/842">video interview</a>).

              <h5>Relativity+</h5>

              <p>John Duffield presents physics with all it's deficiencies to the
              critical lay reader. He gives a brisk, popular but detailed account and
              brings the Williamson Model of the electron, as a self-closed photon, to a
              wider readership. In the process, for example, he covers the weaknesses of
              the Standard Model, Gravity, Black Holes and the neglected importance of
              the governing permeability and permittivity of free space. Here is a
              physics for cyberneticians enabled by Gordon Pask's 1992 mysterious
              assertion that a doubly twisted torus topology is required for analogy and
              dependence. In this book it is applied to the electron. There are 12 pages
              of commented references, many on the web. "Relativity+: The Theory of
              Everything" by John Duffield ISBN 9780956097804 Corella 2009 222 pages

              commercial opportunities in relieving poverty and misery are not apparent
              so one concludes that, though worthy, this not as cybernetically stable as

              <h4>Two new books by members of the Society</h4>

              <h5>A Missing Link in Cybernetics by Alex Andrew</h5>

              <p><img align="left" src="Alex%20Book.jpg" alt=
              "A Missing Link in Cybernetics by Alex Andrew" />The relative failure of
              attempts to analyze and model intelligence can be attributed in part to the
              customary assumption that the processing of continuous variables and the
              manipulation of discrete concepts should be treated separately. Dr Alex
              Andrew considers concept-based thought as having evolved from processing of
              continuous variables. Although "fuzzy" theory acknowledges the need to
              combine conceptual and continuous processing, its assumption of the primacy
              of concept-based processing makes it evolutionarily implausible. The text
              begins by reviewing the origins and aims of cybernetics with particular
              reference to Warren McCulloch's declared lifetime quest of "understanding
              man's understanding". It is shown that continuous systems can undergo
              complex self-organization, but a need for classification of situations
              becomes apparent and can be seen as the evolutionary beginning of
              concept-based processing. Possibilities for complex self-organization are
              emphasized by discussion of a general principle that has been termed
              significance feedback, of which backpropagation of errors in neural nets is
              a special case.</p>

              <p>It is also noted that continuous measures come to be associated with
              processing that is essentially concept-based, as acknowledged in Marvin
              Minsky's reference to heuristic con nection between problems, and the
              associated basic learning heuristic of Minsky and Selfridge. This
              reappearance of continuity, along with observations on the multi-layer
              structure of intelligent systems, supports a potentially valuable view of
              intelligence as having a fractal nature. This is such that structures at a
              complex level, interpreted in terms of these emergent measures, reflect
              others at a simpler level. Implications for neuroscience and Artificial
              Intelligence are also examined.</p>

              <p>The book presents unconventional and challenging viewpoints that will be
              of interest to researchers in AI, psychology, cybernetics and systems
              science, and should help promote further research.</p>

              <h5>Science and Design of Systems by Janos Korn</h5>

              <p><img align="left" src="Korn%20book.JPG" alt=
              "Science and Design of Systems by Janos Korn" />Conventional science views
              parts of the world as phenomena classified according to shared properties,
              which are used to create mathematical relations or models that translate
              notions, fundamental or not, into refutable relationships by exposing them
              to the test of experience. There is another view of parts of the world, the
              view of related objects, the 'systemic view' of complexity and hierarchy,
              which is claimed to be pervasive and indivisible.</p>

              <p>The aim of this book is to show how to convert the systemic view into
              systems science by following the method of conventional science to model
              aspects of the immense variety and diversity of objects (natural,
              technical, living, human and their conceivable combinations) and their
              activities. Having identified the fundamental notions, which are:
              qualitative as well as quantitative properties, objects and their
              relations, and interactions by means of flow of energy or information, the
              latter are organised into inferential structures using mathematics of
              'ordered pairs' and predicate logic statements capable of carrying
              mathematics and/or measures of uncertainties. These structures are
              constructed to enable relations or energy and/or information to propagate,
              to produce an outcome as emergent property or final state, the
              possibilities of occurrence of which can now be investigated.</p>

              <p>A design methodology, elicitation of requirements and a view and design
              of organisations and management are introduced using the inferential
              structures. Systematic thinking about actual, and as yet nonexistent,
              future scenarios, including human activities, has become possible. However,
              the unpredictability of living in particular human behaviour introduces
              additional uncertainty into, and opens debate about, the use of a formal
              method.</p>

              <h4>Call for Symposium C, 20th European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems
              Research</h4>

              <p>The Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research will be held at the
              University of Vienna, Tuesday 6th to Friday 9th April, 2010.</p>

              <p>Symposium C will explore what is often called second order cybernetics.
              In 1968, Margaret Mead, one of the Macy Group that included Norbert
              Wiener&Acirc;&mdash;who in 1948 wrote the seminal and unifying text
              "Cybernetics"&Acirc;&mdash;suggested that the American Society for
              Cybernetics should consider the way it wished to operate as a society in
              the light of understandings developed in cybernetics itself: the society
              for cybernetics should itself be subject to cybernetic analysis and
              development. This reflexive approach became generalised into what Heinz von
              Foerster called Second Order Cybernetics, cybernetics where the nature of
              the circularity in systems is taken seriously (e.g., the controlling
              element of a system is itself controlled by the remainder of the system,
              which it is controlling).</p>

              <p>The second order cybernetic approach is at the heart of understandings
              of interaction, conversation and the creating of the new, all of which are
              central to understandings of the behaviour of humans together, and growing
              in importance in research. In second order cybernetics, the observer is
              recognised as present: Foerster described it as the cybernetics of
              observing (as opposed to observed) systems. Some believe that it returns to
              the basic understandings that drove the original formation of cybernetics,
              and is close to what many of the early cyberneticians, including Bateson,
              Mead and Wiener, and von Foerster, Pask and Ashby had in mind: in effect,
              that all cybernetics is second order, in origin. The symposium will be
              chaired by Ranulph Glanville.</p>

              <div style="margin-left:5%">
                <p>Peter Drucker is widely acknowledged as &Acirc;&lsquo;the father of
                modern management'. The 1st Global Peter F. Drucker Forum,
                &Acirc;&lsquo;Managing the Future', will be held in Vienna, Drucker's
                home city, on the centenary of Drucker's birth (<a href=
                "http://www.druckersociety.at">visit Peter Drucker Society of
                Austria</a>.)</p>

                <p>In addition to invited papers by key thinkers including Charles Handy,
                Philip Kotler and CK Prahalad, the Drucker Society have now opened an
                opportunity for a limited number of contributions from scholars and
                practitioners on themes central to Drucker's work, including:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Repositioning management as a social role</li>

                  <li>The Profession of Management for the 21st century - a new

                  <li>Managing nonprofits in the 21st century</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Submitted papers will be evaluated for presentation at the forum and
                publication in a subsequent special issue of Management Decision. Just as
                Drucker championed in relevant research, reviewers will be paying
                particular attention to how manuscripts critically evaluate Drucker's
                insights and their application to day to day management.</p>

                <p>Specialist reviewers are also being sought for papers submitted to the

              <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a> computational
              knowledge project.</p>

              <p>There are four main parts of the system. The first "curates" data input,
              then methods of computation collected from his earlier <a href=

              and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science">New Kind
              of Science</a> project are applied. A linguistic analysis/understanding
              module, for which he claims ambiguity resolution easier than expected,
              interprets input queries and an automatic formatting engine sends the
              answer to the user. There will be both free and subscription access.</p>

              <p>In his <a href=

              <h4>2nd Quicycle Conference</h4>

              <p>A small group of theoretical physicists met (March 29th- May 2nd) in
              Best, outside Eindhoven (Netherlands) to discuss development of the
              Williamson-van der Mark <a href=
              "http://www.cybsoc.org/cybcon2008prog.htm#jw">self-confined photon
              model</a> of the electron producing, as van der Mark pointed out, a
              circulating current of around 15 amps. Professor Phil Butler (Canterbury
              N.Z.) gave an account of the Clifford Algebra approach. Richard Gauthier
              presented his <a href="http://www.superluminalquantum.org/">transluminal
              energy quantum model</a> of the electron. John Williamson led us through
              his Clifford-Dirac Algebra treatment.</p>

              <p>This is of particular interest to cyberneticians because it applies
              <a href="http://www.cybsoc.org/PasksIAT.PDF">Pask's 1993</a> doubly twisted
              torus topology of dependence and analogy to the necessary electron/photon
              spin transformation.</p>

              <p>Williamson has shown the electron can be regarded as a homeostat because
              when it is hot it is small and when cool (e.g. in solid state) it is large
              and more likely to collide with photons which will heat it up. This may
              extend the domain of cybernetics to sub-atomic particle interactions.
              Professor Butler has a book in preparation.</p>

              and logistics curves. Presenting his "Youth Bulge" theory in a remarkable
              second paper Prof. Dr Dr <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Heinsohn">Gunnar Heinsohn</a> showed
              that wars are sustained only when there are excess well-fed boys in a

              New Scientist (24th January 2009)</a>. The scheme requires no subsidy and
              could produce small amounts of biofuel for sale.</p>

              <p>The idea is for farmers to burn or <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar">"biochar"</a> their waste and by
              controlling the air level produce charcoal. The charcoal must then be

              <h4>Professor Peter Felgett FRS</h4>

              <p>We were sorry to learn of the death of Professor Peter Fellgett over the
              weekend.</p>

              <p>Alex Andrew writes: He was the first Professor of Cybernetics in
              Britain, appointed in Reading in 1964 (a few years before the Appointment
              of Frank George in Brunel). He had previously been on the staff of the
              Royal Observatory in Edinburgh and had been a visiting worker in the Jet
              Propulsion Laboratory in USA. In his earlier work he was responsible for a
              revolutionary improvement in means of recording infrared spectra of stars,
              termed the "Fellgett advantage". In Reading he headed a department in which
              undergraduate courses in cybernetics were set up, as well as research
              projects, in the face of some opposition from scientists in more
              established areas. Among other things he was responsible for a major
              development in sound recording and reproduction, in which use of four

              Kybernetes</a>, writes:</p>

              <p>Kybernetes Vol. 38 Issue 1&amp;2 is published in honour of the memory of
              Professor John (Jack) Rose and to mark his enormous contribution to
              Cybernetics, Systems and other fields, in which he had been so active. It
              is not an obituary but a tribute to his life and a celebration of his
              achievements as a warm human being, a family man and an academic who showed
              such foresight at a time when research and developments in so many areas
              were not adequately communicated worldwide. In this compilation we shall
              concentrate on tributes and contributions written in his memory which
              recall his dedication to systems and cybernetics. We have also included
              three of Prof. Rose's own papers from past issues of Kybernetes.</p>

              <p>Prof. Rose was the Founding Editor of the journal, and was also the
              founder of the World Organisation of Systems and Cybernetics (WOSC)</p>

              <p>Kybernetes is currently offering <a href=

              <h4>On the nature of the electron and other particles</h4>

              <p>After CybCon08 a further talk by Dr John Williamson at the Maxwell
              Society, Room 2C, King's College, October 20th, 2-3 pm, Strand Campus. Open
              to all.</p>

              <p>Abstract: A minimal extension of the Maxwell theory is proposed. This
              introduces forces strong enough to confine electromagnetism, and allow the
              description of purely electromagnetic particles. The origin of charge, half
              integral spin and the exclusion principle are discussed. A speculative
              model for all the hadronic particles is also proposed.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.cybsoc.org/cybcon2008prog.htm#jw">Williamson's
              approach</a> seems to confirm the applicability of Gordon Pask's doubly
              twisted torus topology of analogy and dependence. Pask also suggested a
              Klein Bottle form as necessary for communication between the tautomeric
              resonance forms of his toroidal coherences.</p>

              <p>The meeting was full and followed by a seminar on the mathematical
              approach.</p>

              <h4>Cybernetic Serendipity Redux&Acirc;&mdash;online discussion</h4>

              <p>40 years ago, Jasia Reichart's exhibition "Cybernetic Serendipity"
              showed that the interactive confluence of cybernetics, computing and art
              had arrived.</p>

              <p>(60 years ago, Norbert Wiener published his book "Cybernetics". 50 years
              ago the worlds first electronic performance installation&Acirc;&mdash;the
              Philips Pavilion at the Brussels World Fair&Acirc;&mdash;was launched.)</p>

              <p>40 years later, while computers and art remain, cybernetics has nearly
              vanished, although there is a reviving interest in it in art.</p>

              <p>In remembering Cybernetic Serendipity we have the chance to re-open the
              debate, to reconsider the relationship particularly between cybernetics and
              art, and to do so taking into account the way that cybernetics has
              developed during its period of near invisibility. Thus, we can revisit and
              reconsider: if Cybernetic Serendipity were to be launched today, what
              should go in it, how should it be exhibited, and what would cybernetics and
              art learn from each other?</p>

              <p>That, of course, depends not only on developments in art practice, but
              also (and more critically) on what is new in cybernetics, and how can that
              inform art: and, what is new in art, and how can that inform
              cybernetics.</p>

              <p>This is a chance to reopen the connection, to explore again, and to move
              beyond some of the current models taken from cognitive science, computing,
              AI and AL, and complexity, to the (much more radical) field of their
              origin, cybernetics.</p>

              <p>The immediate celebration will be an online discussion, Cybernetic
              Serendipity Redux, considering art, exhibitions and cybernetics now. This
              will run during September. There is a small team of discussants, to keep
              the ball rolling, but I hope you'll join in as much as you can. You can

              transfer related knowledge into the benefits of practical applications.</p>

              <p>Malik MZSG discussed and presented their approach to management based in

              quality but the setting of goals, the detection of difference, the building

              the Gordon Pask Archive will be open in time for <a href="#emcsr">EMCSR
              (2008)</a>. Pask introduced forces into Cybernetics with <a href=
              "http://www.pangaro.com/PhD-thesis/thesis-top.html">Paul Pangaro</a> and
              later coined the term "new" cybernetics to include the eternal kinetic
              actor interactions that support the production of the bounded kinematic
              descriptions and conversations of observer participants. <a href=

              Organization "Like concepts repel, unlike concepts attract", where concepts
              are procedures composed of spins that produce relations in all media,
              should receive further attention in coming years. "They will come to know",
              he once said.</p>

              <p>Pask's student, Dr Ranulph Glanville, will be chairing Symposium C at
              EMCSR on Second Order Cybernetics "making Gordon the central theme",
              Ranulph tell us. The formal announcement of the Pask Archive will be around
              November 18th when a collection of Pask's papers and essays he has edited

              on the web.</p>

              <p>This is straight out of the management cybernetics textbook ("Brain of

              <p>Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for sector specific

              Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards
              Board (FASB) is advocated. Resistance to complex rules is urged which "can
              produce financial statements that virtually no one understands". Standards
              need, they say, to be principles-based. This promulgates the criticism made
              in the society by <a href=

              (variety) resources are balanced to need with real-time reports of

              <p>We are pleased to report great interest expressed in the English

              <h4 align="center">Robot Perception Research Project</h4>

              <p>An EU funded project is being aimed at giving autonomous machines much
              greater perception abilities. The BACS (Bayesian Approach to Cognitive
              Systems) project, is a project under the 6th Framework Program of the
              European Commission which has been allocated &euro;7.5 million in funding.
              The BACS project brings together researchers and commercial companies
              working on artificial perception systems potentially capable of dealing
              with complex tasks in everyday settings. The scientific work being carried
              out under BACS makes robots with new capabilities a real prospect: robots
              capable of handling incomplete information, analyzing their environment,
              acquiring context-specific knowledge, interpreting the data and, together
              with humans, taking decisions.</p>

              <p>Specific implementations with market potential are planned. A
              prospective implementation with market potential is a system that can
              assist drivers of passenger cars and trucks by employing probabilistic
              control functions and driving strategies. This should make driving safer
              for both drivers and pedestrians. Another area of interest is 3D modelling
              and surveillance of safety-critical applications such as monitoring
              structural changes in buildings or mines and safety-relevant infrastructure
              elements in power lines.</p>

              <p>European industry can use Bayes' alternative calculation models to good
              advantage; they have applications both in major companies in the automotive
              industry and mobile telephony, for example, and in small and medium-size
              companies active in niche markets such as healthcare, inspection,
              monitoring or even market forecasts. <a href=

<h4 align="center">Dr Alex Andrew: "Aren't we dodging the main issues?"<br/> July 31st King's College Council Room 6.30 for 7.00pm
</h4><p>Dr Andrew, Director-General of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics, asks have we lost our focus on understanding understanding? </p><p> Dr Andrew writes: The early aims of cybernetics will be reviewed, with the suggestion that some aspects are still virtually untouched. Warren McCulloch's goal was to achieve "understanding man's understanding" and there is reason to think he viewed this in mechanistic terms inspired by neurophysiology and the advent of digital computers. A similar viewpoint is implicit in Wiener's reference to "the animal and the machine". Despite great advances in techniques for studying neural activity there is still an enormous gulf between, on the one hand, what is understood from work at the neural level and, on the other, what is observed as higher aspects of neural activity including conscious thought.</p><p>

It is however not suggested that the only way to make progress is by exclusive attention to neurophysiology. From its inception cybernetics was meant to be interdisciplinary, and even in the neurological context there are fundamental philosophic questions to be faced, including that of whether an explanation of thought processes in mechanistic terms is possible, and indeed what might be considered an "explanation"...</p><p> 

Even so, it is easy to feel that recent trends have diverted attention from this daunting central issue so as to give a spurious appearance of progress. There is much in modern treatments that has shaky foundations or is credited with more significance than is deserved. I plan to give a "grumpy old man" highly critical view of a number of topics, with the hope that it will be a basis for constructive discussion.

              <h4 align="center">Biologically Plausible Neural Systems and Virtual
              Robotics</h4>

              <p><a href=
              "http://www.cybernetic.org.uk/aics2006/?page=special-sessions">Abstracts
              requested</a> for a special session at the 5th Chapter Conference on
              Advances in Cybernetic Systems 2006 which will run on September 7th or 8th
              Sheffield Hallam University, UK .</p>

              <p>There is a range of connectionist systems, but a much smaller set of
              neural network models corresponding to biological neural networks. Neural
              models range in biological validity through the traditional biological
              Hodgkin Huxley models to Leaky Integrate and Fire models that miss much of
              the biological detail. From a computational perspective, many of the
              biological details may be unnecessary to accurately simulate psychological
              and psychophysical behaviour, and these unnecessary details come with a
              computational cost. One of the challenges is to identify the level of
              detail necessary or beneficial for simulating behaviour at higher
              levels.</p>

              <p>Virtual robotics as an application domain have several advantages. They
              enable the system to behave in domains that people use, in the fashion that
              people act. They do not require full fledged motor and sensing routines, so
              they present a lower implementation barrier. However, they do enable the
              system to ground symbols and provide the possibility of learning based on
              grounded symbols in domains that people use.</p>

              <p>One major virtue to biological and psychological validity when
              simulating neural nets is that direct evidence from behaving biological
              systems can guide development of simulated systems. The fidelity of the
              robots virtual world to an assumed reality provides a minimum level of
              abstraction of the psychological phenomena that can be simulated. Coarse
              granularity in the virtual world, however, can enormously reduce
              computational effort and time while still being appropriate and sufficient
              for investigating more abstractly specified psychological phenomena.
              Consequently, a neural system for a virtual robot is an excellent domain
              for exploring core cybernetics problems such as symbol grounding, learning,
              and interactive behaviour.</p>

              <p>This session will explore issues in biologically plausible neural
              systems, and their relationship to psychological, psychophysical and
              behavioural phenomena using virtual robotics.</p>

              Institute</a> founder and CEO Amory Lovins makes a brilliantly argued case

              emission. He describes a better cultural, economic and engineering
              homeostat for producing transport by applying existing technical know-how
              "to make all modes of transportation lighter and more fuel-efficient, and
              that big, fast change is possible". Lovins finds less than 1% of the energy

              <h4 align="center">"From Newspeak to Cyberspeak: A history of Soviet
              Cybernetics"</h4>

              <p>Stuart Umpleby, an ex-President of the American Society for Cybernetics,
              writes "The interplay between science and politics in the USSR was quite
              amazing". This <a href=
              "http://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/newspeak.htm">book by Slava
              Gerovitch</a> was published by MIT Press in 2002. From the jacket we learn:
              "Soviet cybernetics was not just an intellectual trend but a social
              movement for radical reform in science and in society as a whole. Followers
              of cybernetics viewed computer simulation as a universal method of problem
              solving and the language of cybernetics as a language of objectivity and
              truth. With the new objectivity, they challenged the existing order of
              things in economics and politics as well as in science.</p>

              <p>"Soviet cybernetics followed a curious arc. In the 1950s it was labeled
              a reactionary pseudoscience and a weapon of imperialist ideology. With the
              arrival of Khrushchev's political "thaw," however, it was seen as an
              innocent victim of political oppression, and it evolved into a movement for
              radical reform of Stalinist science. In the early 1960s it was hailed as
              "science in the service of communism," but by the end of the decade it had
              turned into a shallow trend. Using extensive new archival materials,
              Gerovitch argues that these fluctuating attitudes reflected profound
              changes in scientific language and research methodology across disciplines,
              in power relations within the scientific community, and in the political
              role of scientists and engineers in Soviet society. His detailed analysis
              of scientific discourse shows how the Newspeak of the late Stalinist period
              and the Cyberspeak that challenged it eventually blended into
              "Cyber-Newspeak."</p>

              <p>Slava Gerovitch is a Dibner/Sloan Postdoctoral Researcher at the Dibner
              Institute for the History of Science and Technology and a Research
              Associate at the Institute for the History of Natural Science and
              Technology of the Russian Academy of Sciences."</p>

              <p>"An exceptionally lively and interesting book. This is by far the
              best-informed and most insightful account of cybernetics in the Soviet
              Union." David Holloway, Raymond A. Spruance Professor of International
              History, Stanford University.</p>

              <p>"Cybernetics was among the most important intellectual movements of the
              mid-twentieth century. Nowhere was its curious blend of mathematical
              technique, ideology, information technology, and postmodern scientific
              universalism more controversial or more interesting, than in the Soviet
              Union during the early Cold War. Slava Gerovitch is among the first
              scholars to command the linguistic skills, cultural resources, and
              historical awareness to offer a definitive account. From "Newspeak to
              Cyberspeak" not only sheds new light on the byzantine intellectual world of
              the Soviet Union, but holds up a fascinating mirror to the West as well.
              This is a groundbreaking achievement that deserves a wide audience." Paul

              <h4 align="center">President calls for Government to back Robotics
              Competition</h4>

              <p>Should the UK instigate a Grand Challenge along the lines of the USA's
              competition to build a robotic vehicle to cross the desert unaided?</p>

              <p>This was a topic of conversation at a workshop held by The National
              Advanced Robotics Research Centre NARRC at the University of Salford on
              December the 1st.</p>

              <p>Robotics is widely predicted to be the growth technology of the 21st
              century in a similar fashion to the way the motor car was the major
              technology of the 20th. The UK is lagging way behind, Japan, America and
              Korea. The USA's Defense Advanced Projects Agency DARPA Grand Challenge was
              to build and race self navigating autonomous ground vehicles over a 132
              mile (212km) course in the Mojave Desert, Nevada for a cash prize of 2
              million dollars.</p>

              <p>One of the NARRC delegates, David Buckley, has suggested a competition
              for a humanoid (biped) robot to negotiate a short obstacle course, pick up
              an empty drinks can and return to the start of the course with the can and
              place it on a table. It is difficult and expensive to make an advanced
              humanoid biped robot; the word's most advanced humanoid, Honda's ASIMO, is
              reputed to have cost over $140m to date. However useful robots need to work
              in our built environment; climb stairs, open doors, work at table top
              height, etc. The potential market for humanoid robots is huge if the cost
              can be made low enough. Early applications are likely to be in the areas of
              the three D's dirty, dangerous or dull. David suggests that there could be
              four classes of humanoid in various heights up to 2m tall. Radio control
              would be allowed. But who would fund the prize, the DTI, the MoD, the
              Department of Education or industry perhaps? It has been a long time since
              the UK government took such a step.</p>

              <p>The last time was when the problem of deducing longitude at sea was
              solved in 1764 by the engineer John Harrison who created the first accurate
              seaworthy clock. The problem had been unsolved despite the best efforts of
              Galileo, Cassini and Newton until the Board of Longitude (the first science
              funding body in the UK) set up by the King and Parliament paid out the
              &pound;20,000 prize money. The society's president would be delighted to

              <p>Constructivist Foundations (CF) is an independent academic peer-reviewed
              e-journal without commercial interests. Its aim is to promote scientific
              foundations and applications of constructivist sciences, to weed out
              pseudoscientific claims and to base constructivist sciences on sound
              scientific foundations, which do not equal the scientific method with
              objectivist claims. The journal is concerned with the interdisciplinary
              study of all forms of constructivist sciences, especially radical

              feedback, systems and boundaries, constructivism, multiple realities or
              perspectives, dynamic simulations, and activities that build upon the
              possibilities and limitations of human and other information processing

              <p>18th-21st April 2006 in Vienna. The closing date for <a href=
              "http://www.osgk.ac.at/emcsr/">submitting papers</a> is 11th October
              2005</p>

              <p>Cybernetics - "the study of communication and control in the animal and
              the machine" (N.Wiener) - has recently returned to the forefront, not only
              in cyberspace and cyberpunk, but, even more important, contributing to the
              corroboration of various scientific theories. Additionally, an ever
              increasing number of research areas, including social and economic
              theories, theoretical biology, ecology, computer science, and robotics draw
              on ideas from second order cybernetics. Artificial intelligence, evolved
              directly from cybernetics, has not only technological and economic, but
              also important social impacts. With a marked trend towards
              interdisciplinary cooperation and global perspectives, this important role
              of cybernetics is expected to be further strengthened over the next
              years.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.osgk.ac.at/emcsr/">Sixteen sessions</a> are
              planned.</p>

              <p>Ranulph Glanville writes: "EMCSR is one of the longest established and
              highest prestige conferences in the field of cybernetics/systems research.
              It has been associated closely with several major figures and the
              development of a number of important concepts in cybernetics/systems
              research." There is a briefing session on the next EU Reseach Framework.
              Ranulph will be chairing a session on "The Cybernetics of Cybernetics:

              <p>In the middle of the last century, Norbert Wiener-ex-child prodigy and
              brilliant MIT mathematician -founded the science of cybernetics, igniting
              the information-age explosion of computers, automation, and global
              telecommunications. Wiener was the first to articulate the modern notion of
              "feedback," and his ideas informed the work of computer pioneer John von
              Neumann, information theorist Claude Shannon, and anthropologists Gregory
              Bateson and Margaret Mead. His best-selling book, Cybernetics, catapulted
              him into the public spotlight, as did his chilling visions of the future
              and his ardent social activism. So what happened? Why is his work virtually
              unknown today? And what, in fact, is Wiener's legacy? In this remarkable
              book, award-winning journalists Conway and Siegelman set out to rescue
              Wiener's genius from obscurity and to explore the many ways in which his
              groundbreaking ideas continue to shape our lives. Based on a wealth of
              primary sources (including some newly declassified WW II and Cold War-era
              documents) and exclusive interviews with Wiener's family and closest
              colleagues, the book reveals an extraordinarily complex figure, whose
              high-pressure childhood, manic depression, and troubled relationships had a
              profound effect on his scientific work. No one interested in the
              intersection of technology and culture will want to miss this epic story of
              one of the twentieth century's most brilliant and colorful figures.</p>

              complexity and the nature of existence</a></h4>

              <p><a href="http://www.mth.uct.ac.za/~ellis/">Professor George Ellis</a>
              lectures on the central doctrine of classical multi-level cybernetics. This
              <a href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/page.asp?id=2825">video feed</a> is from
              the Royal Society <a href="http://www.templeton.org/">Templeton</a>
              Lecture. Newcomers to cybernetics will find this a useful introduction. A
              tour-de force indeed. Enjoy but...</p>

              <p>Controversially he claims that the "goals" and "information" of
              cybernetics cannot be applied to objects smaller than supramolecules. This
              denies that force equilibria and the second law of thermodynamics apply
              below this level and smuggles a ghost into his machine. Professor Lewis
              Wolpert exorcises the ghost at question time. If physics improves the
              precision of descriptions it is not clear that Ellis' position on
              consciousness, that no experiment is possible to predict a new experiment,
              holds. Prof Lord May remarks that animals (that might evolve into
              physicists) are conscious. The <a href=
              "http://www.cybsoc.org/ross.htm#goodreg">Conant-Ashby Theorem</a> (which
              asserts "Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system")
              extends some form of consciousness to all self-regulating, persisting or
              stable, distinguishable objects, like tables, rocks, atoms etc.</p>

              <p>Pask, for whom durations were incommensurable for communicating domains,
              has shown (with his <a href="http://www.cybsoc.org/PasksIAT.PDF">Lambda
              matrix</a> p.49) causal asynchronous communication between synchronous
              circular processes, homeostats, requires a relativistic correction
              banishing master clocks and adopting coherence as boundary defining.</p>

              <p>Prof Ellis adopts circularity but not its interior lack of causality. He
              criticises physics failure to predict the weather or model chess players
              but does not identify "agreement" with "equilibrium" or the pathology of
              serial/parallel computing and mathematical methods in n-body problems- a
              property not shared by nature which like a mechanical model is concurrently
              constrained.</p>

              <p>On the first day amidst much discussion posters were presented by Dr
              Y.I. Hayut-Man, Academy of Jerusalem, who presented an approach to a
              Virtual New Jerusalem to celebrate the Abrahamic Religions. Nick Green,
              Real Time Study Group, talked about management cybernetics of NHS IT in the
              NPfITplans.</p>

              <p>Papers were given by Leonie Solomons, Sunderland University, applying
              Beer's Viable System Model (VSM) to development in Sri Lanka. Margeret
              Heath, Free University of Brussels, discussed VSM and the issues for
              cognitive science it poses.</p>

              <p>On the second day Prof Alfredo Moscardini suggested closer affiliations
              between The Society, Metaphorum and Cybernetics North. Dr Allenna Leonard
              facilitated Dr Marcela Villarreal, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation,
              who discussed the impact of AIDS in Africa on Agriculuture and development
              solutions required and John Clarke, UN Health Organisation, who discussed
              the difficulties of getting appropriate responses from agencies.</p>

              <p>In the afternoon Dr Steve Wright, Omega Foundation, discussed his
              analysis of the Northern Ireland conflict and drew the Society's attention
              to social control technologies under development. Dr Paul Stokes,
              University College Dublin, discussed improving the applicabity of VSM to
              the Social Sciences and Luc Hoebeke criticised aspects of the paradigm
              under application. This most expert group of management cyberneticians was
              highly appreciative of the subsequent discussion which clearly will
              continue.</p>

              <p>The surviving 91 pages of Pask's previously unpublished 1993 manuscript
              have been assembled for <a href="PasksIAT.PDF">download</a> in .pdf format
              (last corrected 13/4/04). An index and table of contents has been added by
              Nick Green who worked with him in the last years of his life. In an
              extraordinary and wide ranging development of the earlier Conversation
              Theory (CT) Pask compares and contrasts his development of CT with IA</p>

              <p>The style is dense but enlivened with wit, charm and criticism of
              conventional methods.</p>

              <p>This work is foundational to the establishment of the <a href=
              "http://www.nickgreen.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/PIA2.PDF">Borromean Link
              model</a> of learning, self-organising, continuity (or evolution) around a
              void and the current work on the strict coherence interpretation of
              Interaction.</p>

              <p>From paragraph 326 in speaking of the new dynamic form of his
              proto-logic Lp he states "..resonance or local synchronicity of in-phase
              oscillations, radiating into an Lp field make sense."</p>

              <p>The work was intended to put the so-called soft sciences on a stricter
              foundation. It re-interprets existing relativistic and string theory
              constraints with a general theory of force and organisation establishing
              cybernetics on a firm basis for future application. It remains to be seen
              if it will be accepted.</p>

              <p>Pask's last paper "<a href=

              <p>From the BBC: The rail industry is riddled with "uncontrollable costs"
              and needs fundamental change, according to a report by an environmental
              group.</p>

              <p>The report uncovered "the staggering scale of costs and inefficiencies
              and secrecy", <a href="http://www.transport2000.org.uk/">Transport 2000</a>
              said.</p>

              <p>"This kind of waste appears routine in the unaccountable Public Service
              bureaucracies of the world" said our Council member Nick Green FCybS today,

              solve this problem." The Group's approach is based on formally escalating
              alerts through the management system. Stafford Beer called this Algedonic

              improvements and needed to be changed, said the report from the Commons

              <p>With the vice-president in the chair Nick Green FCybS talked to our
              November Meeting about the application of Pask's <a href=
              "http://www.nickgreen.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/PIA2.PDF">Interactions of Actors
              Axioms</a> to Development and Differentiation in Beer's Viable System
              Model. Pask produced a force based learning model where all persisting
              closed looping processes were regarded as concepts. Here self-organisation
              and evolution become equivalent.</p>

              <p>An interesting discussion followed. Some members seemed to have
              difficulty with Pask's introduction of force into Cybernetics. Coherence
              and differentiation were how Pask saw this approach developing. Now
              concepts exert forces and we have the Borromean resonance model of
              continuity.</p>

              <p>The late Donald Mackay amongst his many achievements and provoking
              insights was noted for his two types of information (Phil. Mag., 1950, 41,
              289 ). In his talk to the Society Alex Andrew described them as structural
              classifiers: logons and "fine-tuning" or metrical types: metrons. Alex has
              prepared a list of <a href=
              "http://pages.britishlibrary.net/alexandrew/MacKay(early)Refs.html">Mackay's
              publications</a> with some introductory remarks. We hope to resume
              discussion of his themes at our Meeting in 29th March 2004 (last Monday of
              every month is usual).</p>

              Centenary Conference</a></h4>

              <p>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign March 4-6, 2004</p>

              <p>Ashby's Requisite Variety, fundamental to our discipline, describes the
              equilibrium state of homeostasis. In 1994 because of the dynamic character
              of equilibrium Prof. Eugene Yates introduced the term "homeodynamics". In
              his 2002 paper for a National Institute of Health Conference on Aging "
              <a href=
              "http://www.biodynamichealthaging.org/Abstracts/YatesNIAsynopsis.pdf">From
              Homeostasis to Homeodynamics</a>", he distinguishes C.H. Waddington's
              "homeorhesis" and Iberall and Soodak's "homeokinetics" ("Homeokinetics: A
              physical science for complex systems" Science, 201: 579, 1978). A less used
              term is "rheostasis" coined by Nicholas Mrosovsky and discussed in his
              monograph "Rheostasis: The Physiology of Change" (OUP 1990 ISBN 0195061845)
              where the changing of the set-point of the homeostat is considered.</p>

              <p>Restrictions on the applicability of the Law of Requisite Variety
              continue to be discussed.</p>

              <p>From theories of pedestrian movement and traffic flow to voting
              processes, economic markets and war, researchers are striving towards a
              physics of society. Thanks, again, to Tony Booth for pointing this out.</p>

              <p>The author, Philip Ball, is a science writer and journalist working in
              London. This article is based on his forthcoming book <i><b>Critical Mass:
              How One Thing Leads To Another</b></i> (Heinemann), which is due to be
              published in January 2004.</p>

              <p>Members may remember Ron Atkin's work on traffic through hypergraphs and
              his "q-analysis". Ball's approach is somewhat evocative of this but the
              problems, principally the lack of applicable data, that prevented further
              application of Catastrophe Theory, for example, may also be an obstacle
              here. Jacky Legrand of D&eacute;partement Informatique Universit&eacute;
              Paris 2 has an interesting primer and <a href=
              "http://www.afscet.asso.fr/resSystemica/Crete02/Legrand.pdf">critique</a>
              of the Atkin approach.</p>

              <p>Although the route to sustainable development is clearing there is still
              some resistance to accountability to be overcome. The application of
              Cybernetics, rather than Physics, to move to Utopia is surely something we
              could formally address as a Society.</p>

              <p>But can today's computers really "Do anything"? Tim suggests, at the end
              of his talk, this has been proved mathematically. This is a common mistake.
              Turing Universality implies decomposability into binary relations but does
              not imply generally applicable. Better to recognise, as currently realised,
              digital machines are limited to competence in serial or parallel process
              emulation and mathematics. Nature by contrast is concurrent. Let us hope
              Tim's apparent suspicion of self-reference and reliance on metalanguage are
              not similarly flawed. Thoroughly recommended a very stimulating talk. Now

              passengers are now ready for mobile solutions, in much the same way as
              commuters experience on the railways. Such an opportunity to enter a market
              in its infancy cannot be missed."<br />

              <h5>Alexander Lerner dies at 90</h5>

              <p>A.Ya.Lerner was best known in the Society for his "Fundamentals of
              Cybernetics" (SBN 412100703) published in the USSR in 1967 and translated
              in 1972 for Chapman and Hall with a forward by Frank George. Those finding
              the "<a href="#core">Core Cybernetics</a>" of MIT demanding will find his
              book a delight. He was a patriach of the "refusenik" colony of
              Moscow.<br />

In the great variety of connected pages you can find some information about IFAC, the International Federation of Automatic Control, its aims, activities, outputs, organization, as well as some of the people (officers and officials) serving the Federation on a voluntary basis.</p> <p><br />The <a href="about/overview/aims" title="Aims">aims</a> of the Federation are to promote the science and technology of control in the broadest sense in all systems, whether, for example, engineering, physical, biological, social or economic, in both theory and application. IFAC is also concerned with the impact of control technology on society.</p> <p><br /> We are challenging the new era in electronic communication, publication, and exchange of ideas. The next IFAC World Congress, to be held in <a href="http://www.ifac2014.org" class="external-link">Cape Town, South Africa</a>, in the year 2014, will be an exposure to the use of such new technology. Join us, participate in any IFAC event and/or journal. Our aim is to offer you an excellent and enjoyable, both professional and personal, relationship.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>William T. Powers, the engineer/psychologist who developed Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) passed away on May 24, 2013 at the age of 86.&nbsp; PCT is a revolutionary and exciting theory of human behavior, one that invalidates much of what currently passes as psychological research and existing theories of human behavior.&nbsp; Essentially, PCT views people as purposeful, living control systems, whose behavior shapes its consequences instead of the other way around.&nbsp; PCT is a feedback-governed view of human behavior.&nbsp; It holds that we target certain variables for control and we compare our perceptions of the current state of those variables with our goal state or reference condition for those variables.&nbsp; If unacceptable gaps exist, we behave in ways that serve to close those gaps.&nbsp; Thus it is that our behavior serves to control our perceptions.&nbsp; There are, however, other actors and factors at work that influence the same variables we are trying to control.&nbsp; Ordinarily these disturbances as they are known in PCT are compensated for and pose no problem.&nbsp; On occasion they can prove overwhelming.&nbsp; Our control is far from perfect.&nbsp; PCT abounds with insights, implications and new directions for researchers, those who simply want to understand human behavior and those who would manage human performance in the workplace.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Powers will be laid to rest next to his wife, Mary, in a cemetery overlooking the city of Durango, CO.&nbsp; His work will continue, pursued by those who came to know Powers and PCT.&nbsp; His theory will someday receive the recognition it deserves  and so will he. <br />

Historically, the field of cybernetics has relied on conferences and similar events as the context for bringing together people from diverse disciplines who have similar interests.  Cybernetics itself coalesced as a discipline during the 1940's in a series of meetings called the Macy Conferences.
<P>
Continuing this tradition, the American Society for Cybernetics has long emphasized the role of regular gatherings in fostering understanding and the exchange of ideas.
<P>
ASC sponsors conferences and other occasional events to provide the multidisciplinary field of cybernetics a focal venue for such interactions.
<P>
This Webpage provides a summary overview of ASC's most recent conferences as well as a listing of major cybernetics events dating back to the original Macy conferences in the 1940's.

2008 represented the 50th anniversary of the founding, by Heinz von Foerster, of the Biological Computer Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Urbana / Champaign.  The BCL a cauldron of cybernetics and the home of second order cybernetics, featured a star studded cast of membes and visitors.  Heinz was also one of the founders of the ASC, which has provided a spiritual home for second order cybernetics since its origination.
<P>
Our conference celebrated this remarkable laboratory in joint festival with the Department of Electrical Engineering at UIUC, which was the umbrella under which the BCL sheltered. 
<P>
This event was organized to coincide with the 8th Understanding Complex Systems (UCS) Symposium (12 - 15 May) on the topic <I>Informatics, Energy and Others</I>.

ASC's 2001 Conference was held May 27 - 29, 2001 (with extended activities May 23 - 25) at the University of British Columbia Conference Center in Vancouver.
<P>
The theme of the 2001 Conference was:
<P> 
The Praxis of Cybernetics and the Cybernetics of Praxis 
<P>
In our 2001 conference we explored and discussed the "praxis" of cybernetics, that is, its application in any domain. Equally important, we also explored the cybernetics of praxis, that is, what the awareness of how we do what we do modulates our activity in any domain. This was a conference for the practical and for the visionary. As such we envisioned it as an event of interest for the practical visionary and the reflective practitioner. We could say that we are concerned with the heart and soul of what we do.

        <h2>The Major is designed primarily for highly motivated students interested 
          in interdisciplinary activities in life sciences, behavioral sciences, 
          and the computational, control, communication and information branches 
          of engineering and computer sciences. Primary emphasis is on integrative 
          computational and systems biology studies. Students have several options 
          for in-depth studies: a coherent integration of courses selected from 
          one of five designated concentrations in Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, 
          Neurosystems, Biomedical Systems or Computers &amp; Biosystems; or from the broader 
          concentration areas of life sciences, behavioral sciences, engineering 
        and applied mathematical sciences, from these areas.</h2>
